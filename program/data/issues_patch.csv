Now, if there are multiple images referenced on a page, with only one of them invalid, Redmine currently doesn't create @<img>@ tags for any of them since it would return from the replacement method too soon.

In the ""IssuesHelper#details_to_strings"":/projects/redmine/repository/entry/trunk/app/helpers/issues_helper.rb method (source:trunk/app/helpers/issues_helper.rb@16387#L373) a new class (Struct) is created each time the method is called:

<pre><code class=""ruby"">
  multiple_values_detail = Struct.new(:property, :prop_key, :custom_field, :old_value, :value)

Although classes are garbage collected in recent Ruby versions, it might be better to use a constant definition outside the method, like:

  MultipleValuesDetail = Struct.new(:property, :prop_key, :custom_field, :old_value, :value)

I fixed it with the following changes:
* *1. Fix HTML structure of form#query_form on calendar/gantt views.*
This unifies the HTML structure of the query form on the calendars/show
and gantts/show views to be the same as it is currently for the issues
and spent time views, which were themself unified into the new
queries/_query_form partial in r15649.
* *2. Fix source indentation and newline usage.*
This unifies the source layout of the query form on the calendars/show
and the gantts/show views with the queries/_query_form partial.
* *3. Unify form#query_form structure on calendar/gantt views.*
This:
** moves the p with inline style on the calendar view (which
wraps the navigation buttons) out of div#query_form_content
and adds the contextual class to the element to unify this
with the gantt view (and to remove the inline style from
the element now that it's styled through a stylesheets'
style [.contextual in fact]);
** restores the 12px font-size of the calendar navigation
buttons;
** increases the font-size of the gantt zoom buttons to 12px;
** increases the margin of the calendar navigation and gantt
zoom buttons to 12px 0px.
* *4. Add test assertions to the four controller test cases.*

1/ current version
<pre>EXISTS (SELECT 1 AS one FROM enabled_modules em WHERE em.project_id = projects.id AND em. NAME = 'issue_tracking')</pre>

2/ previous version (actually faster even without an index on enabled modules)

3/ fastest version (in some cases better indexes were used)

Patches:
* revert of #21608, because the previous version was faster (about 30%)
* new index ""enabled_modules_name"", but it's not very helpful unless you have many projects (3000+)
* implementation of visible conditions with inner join instead of subselect, it passes all tests, but it should be refactored. I want to know what do you think about it first

Since the global issue view is often used as a quick filter to check what is happening in all projects, filtering by any visible version would allow to drill down from there instead of having to first select the correct parent project and then starting the filter there. Also, with saved shared queries, a common starting point is the global issue view instead of individual projects.

The attached patch removes the restriction to only allow filtering by system-shared versions. Instead, it allows filtering by any version visible to the current user."

* adds a class ""left"" for existing contextual class to let the icons aligned to left (according to the #24720)

h3. move_delete_and_reset_above_the_list.patch

* moves the ""Delete"" link from wiki tab on the same line with the wiki input field. I find it more natural to be there.

Currently we can see very small (14px) assignee's icon in ""Assignee"" field but it is not noticeable. If attached patch (attachment:0001-Show-assignee-s-icon-in-addition-to-author-s-icon.patch) is applied, assignee's icon will be much noticeable and we can easily know current assignee.

Running the query without @lock@ first and locking the found record second solved the problem for us.

To account for the possible failure of the inner lock (i.e. when @existing@ was found but cannot be locked) this patch also adds a @rescue@ clause that silently ignores such errors. Deduplication did not happen in this case either because the duplicate was removed (then a retry would be useless) or the database aborted the transaction (deadlock or waited too long for the lock, a retry might work but I'm not sure it's worth it).

I know that there are a more instances in the code base where we assume @params[:foo]@ to be a hash without explicit type checking. This patch does not attempt to address this problem on a global level. For whatever reason it happens to us quite often in this particular place, causing false alerts in server monitoring.

This patch adds an explicit type check to resolve this @params[:query]@ case. As a bonus it makes the following 4 lines where values are taken out of the hash a bit nicer.

In general I think it would be preferably to raise an error of the 4xx class in such cases. Are there any plans to make use of Rails' Strong Parameters feature in the future? I think using these permit / require calls on parameters in controllers would catch such wrong types early and would lead to responses with a more appropriate error code automatically."

This results in a change of the @issue#show@ API which now also returns an Integer instead of a Float. Previously (in Redmine 3.2), the API used to return the data the following way:

<pre><code class=""json"">
{
  ""issue"": {
    ""id"": 15,
    ...
    ""spent_hours"": 0.0,
    ...
  }
}
</code></pre>

While later versions (including the current trunk) return them as follows:

<pre><code class=""json"">
{
  ""issue"": {
    ""id"": 15,
    ...
    ""spent_hours"": 0,
    ...
  }
}
</code></pre>

This appears to break strict API clients which expect a float there. In our tests, this change appears to break the current Android version of RedminePM, probably due to some internal type exceptions. The attached patch was extracted from ""Planio"":https://plan.io/redmine-hosting and fixes this behavior. With it, we follow the previous behavior of always sending Floats.
