Our Redmine server is located in central Europe (CEST, or GMT+1), I am located in Texas (CT, or GMT-6). When I set my personal timezone accordingly in ""My account"", time entries under ""spent time"" are not showing up properly anymore. Instead, to see today's time entries I have to select ""yesterday"" from the dropdown menu, and to see this week's time entries I have to select ""last week"". And to make matters worse it somehow also depends on my personal language preference configured under ""My account"" as well:

# time zone GMT+1, language German
** all good; see attached screenshots 1_de_cest_today & 2_de_cest_thisweek. This is what I expect to see regardless of time zone and language.
# time zone GMT-6, language German
** today = yesterday; see 3_de_ct_today & 4_de_ct_yesterday,
** this week = broken, monday is missing and can be found in last week's view; see 5_de_ct_thisweek & 6_de_ct_lastweek
# time zone GMT-6, language English
** today = yesterday, same behavior as in 2
** this week = working, monday showing up as expected, see 7_en_ct_thisweek & 8_en_ct_lastweek

This has only started after the update from Redmine 3.1.1 to 3.3.3 yesterday, it was all working perfectly fine until just yesterday. I also have to add that this happens independent of time and date. The time and date, when those screenshots were taken:

CEST in Europe: 6/13/2017, 6:00pm
CT in Texas: 6/13/2017, 11:00am

I've tried this yesterday as well when it was around 10pm in Europe and 3pm in Texas, and later also when it was 6pm in Texas but already 1am the next day in Europe. Results were the same.

If there are stray links to that URL, these generate a 403 error, which for anonymous users redirects to the login/registration page.

In our case, we had projects that served files publicly, then moved these to another location and turned off the Files module. The result is we now get a lot of spurious registration requests from users who are trying to download these files, because to the user it looks like the site is asking them to register before they can access the files.

I was able to address our immediate problem by patching ApplicationController.authorize to check whether the request is associated with a disabled project module, and redirect to the main project page in that case. I'm not sure how correct this code is (I don't know the Redmine internals all that well) and I know that this doesn't work for some modules (eg. Issues) which apparently operate through some other method. So this code is just for illustration, I guess.

* 1. Create a level 1 issue.  This will be the parent of all other issues.  Let's call it Issue #100
* 2. Then create any number greater than 1 subtasks of that parent.  We will create five and say they are issue ID's 110, 120, 130, 140, and 150.
* 3. Now under issue ID create a subtask with issue ID 111.  That will work fine.
* Here comes the problem:
* 4. Move 111 to 150 and it will be abandoned.
* 5. Move 111 to 140 and it will say 140 is the parent, but it will actually be placed under 150.

Looking at the issues table in SQL the problem seems to be that the lft and rgt fields do not increment when adding the new subtask to a new parent that did not have tasks previously.  So, the new task fails over to the next available range of lft rgt bounds.  If there is no parent to that range then the issue is orphaned, otherwise it assigns the issue to the next range available, but not the one that the user desires even though the application will say the tasks is a child of the correct parent.

---

Our current workaround is as follows using the example from above:
Edit issue 140 or 150 whichever you are working with as follows.  Remove the parent of 100 and set it to blank and save. Then edit issue 111 so that it has no parent and save it.  Go back to issue 140 or 150 and set the parent to 100 and save it.  Then go to issue 111 and assign to either 140 or 150 and it will now work.

Tested on Redmine 3.2.0
</pre>

_(I consider it as a bug, but it may be standard behaviour, which would be a really strange design decision)_

I discovered this after receiving a report that the group which was assigned on an issue couldn't see it. This was normal, because the group was not a member of the related project. But I don't know how the issue could have been assigned to this group since only project members are assignable (even after investigating, I still don't know how it could have happened).

So I uninstalled all plugins on my integration environment, to avoid any plugin-related strange behaviour which could cause that. Then tried to replace the currently assigned user/group ID directly in HTML page (with Chrome ""Inspect Element""), just to see if it was a client or server side problem. This led me to this bug report :

- When replacing with the ID of *another user/group from same project*, the issue is saved normally, and the issue is assigned to given group _(this is standard behaviour)_
- When replacing by the ID of *a user/group which is NOT a member of the project*, +it also works+ _(*this should not work*. Even though assigned user/group can't see the issue, it shouln't even be assignable in the first place)_
- When replacing by the ID of *a group which is un-assignable globally* _(= has only an un-assignable role)_, +it also works+
- When replacing by the ID of *a non-existing user/group*, +it also works+ _(when the issue is saved, the current assignee is just set to """" in web page, and the given ID is set in database)_

!https://redmine.org/attachments/download/18421/!

This doesn't seem to be the proper way it should be working.
It also allows user/group listing across the entire Redmine instance, which could be considered as a security threat.


PS : I can't test on a more recent version than 3.2.0 ATM, sorry for that. _(it takes 10 sec to reproduce, just inspect element with Chrome, set ID to ""9999999"" for currently selected option, and save issue)_"

While reviewing/researching #25634 (and in its extend, r16501 & r16502 for #25503), I noticed three issues with the implementation - both pre and post r16568:
# @Redmine::SyntaxHighlighting::CodeRay.language_supported?@ includes internal CodeRay scanners (@default@, @debug@, @raydebug@ & @scanner@)
# @Redmine::SyntaxHighlighting::CodeRay.language_supported?@ has multiple responsibilities:
## retrieval of the array of supported languages symbols from CodeRay library
### storing of a reference to the resulting array in a local variable
## checking if the passed @language@ argument is included in the array referenced by the local variable and return the result
# the array containing supported languages symbols is rebuild for every invocation of @Redmine::SyntaxHighlighting::CodeRay.language_supported?@, ie. for each and every pre-formatted, syntax-highlighted code block (this seems a uselessly CPU-intensive approach since the array's values won't change unless Redmine is restarted)

h2. Fixes/changes

I've applied the following four changes to solve each of the three issues:

* _change 1 (0001-Remove-internal-CodeRay-scanners.patch)_: remove the four internal CodeRay scanners by subtracting a hard-coded array containing the symbols of these scanners
** It does not seem to be possible to do this in a more dynamical way.
* _change 2 (0002-Pull-up-retrieve_supported_languages-private-class-m.patch)_: pull-up a new @Redmine::SyntaxHighlighting::CodeRay.retrieve_supported_languages@ private class method (that doesn't store the result)
* _change 3 (0003-Use-stored-ref.-to-array-holding-supported-languages.patch)_: use a stored reference to the resulting array ? retrieved by @Redmine::SyntaxHighlighting::CodeRay.retrieve_supported_languages@, holding the supported languages symbols ? via a constant[1]
** I think there are two ways of solving this: storing a reference to the resulting array 1) in a _memoized instance variable_ or 2) in a _constant_. After some benchmarking[1] I decided to go with the constant-storage approach as it seems a tiny bit faster than the memoized instance variable storage approach. Though, both approaches are ~360-400 times faster than the approaches where the array is rebuild on every invocation of @Redmine::SyntaxHighlighting::CodeRay.language_supported?@.
* _change 4 (0004-Tests-for-Redmine-SyntaxHighlighting-CodeRay.retriev.patch)_: add test-coverage for @Redmine::SyntaxHighlighting::CodeRay.retrieve_supported_languages@ and remove obsolete @ApplicationHelperTest#test_syntax_highlight_by_coderay_alias@ (there's no need to test through @textilizable@)

My first guess was that theres a directory of file in the repository that has an invalid char as a name, so I wrote a little script to check all filenames against a regex and we just found a file containing a ~ in the name.

We had this repository working before, so the file must be added in the last 1 to 2 month but the file containing the ~ was added 2 years ago.

I already tried to re add the repository with no success and other repositories I added as a test also work.

Thanks for your help in advance!"

</pre>

it is already fixed, but the change wasn't backported to the 0.3.x branch
https://github.com/brianmario/mysql2/issues/606

I can confirm the issue is gone after upgrading to the current version 0.4.6.

This version is still compatible with Ruby 1.9+ and it passes redmine tests. I also run our specs and it looks like everything is ok.

Notable changes:
<pre>
* mysql 8 support
* prepared statements support
* connection.close/shutdown fix
* many bugfixes
</pre>
