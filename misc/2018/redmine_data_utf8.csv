I am running Redmine with the following versions:
Environment:
  Redmine version                2.5.1.stable.13174
  Ruby version                   2.0.0-p481 (2014-05-08) [x86_64-linux]
  Rails version                  3.2.18
  Environment                    production
  Database adapter               Mysql2
SCM:
  Subversion                     1.8.8
  Git                            1.9.1

Redmine is installed on Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS (GNU/Linux 3.13.0-24-generic x86_64)

In *Configure* section of the howto, in the box following the text that says ""add following lines somewhere in your /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf..."", the action line (action = iptables-allports[name=redmine]) is a bit heavy handed as it bans all ports, not only http and https. 

This is a problem, especially in view of the fact that the rest of the howto fails to inform you that Redmine doesn't prepends logged lines with a time stamp in ""production.log"" with the result that ""when you're banned, you're banned forever ever ever ever... on all ports, including SSH which might be your only possible access to a cloud server. I got locked out ! Fortunately, DigitalOcean VMs have a remote console access that I could use to get out of trouble.

Here are the changes that propose based on my production setup that has successfully tested in the above mentioned environment:
# No changes should me made to /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf as this file gets overwritten every time fail2ban gets updated. Instead, it is recommended to create or add to a file named /etc/fail2ban/jail.local;
#  The content of the Redmine section in /etc/fail2ban/jail.local should read as follow:
@
[redmine]
enabled  = true
filter   = redmine
port     = http,https
logpath  = /srv/redmine/log/production.log
maxretry = 5
findtime = 600
bantime = 600
@
This would have the effect of banning the IP address of a client trying to connect on ports HTTP and HTTPS for 10 minutes,  after it has seen 5 failed login reties within the last 10 minutes. 
# The howto contains some explanation about findtime and bantime that is not in line with fail2ban's documentation and the result of using the large numbers that are proposed in the howto would not yeld good results.
# Note that on my production setup the default location of Redmine's production log is in /srv/redmine/production.log
# A section should be added to explain how to get redmine to add a timestamp in front of each line production.log, and it should read as follow ""Add the following to /srv/redmine/config/environment.rb :""
@
class Logger
 def format_message(severity, timestamp, progname, msg)
 ""#{timestamp} (#{$$}) #{msg}\n"" 
 end

18095,Redmine,Defect,NA,Confirmed,Normal,Unable to submit time entries via REST API for activities that have become project-specific,Alex MacAulay,NA,2014-11-14T11:43:00Z,REST API,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,2014-10-14T17:34:00Z,NA,NA,NA,2.5.2,"Steps to reproduce: Create a new project. In web interface, go to ""Settings"" tab, then go to ""Activities (time tracking)"" tab. Deactivate an activity (let's say ""Design"") by unchecking the checkbox. Click ""Save"". Then reactivate the activity by re-checking the checkbox. Click ""Save"".

At this point, there is a project-specific activity for the ""Design"" activity in the Redmine database, in addition to the system-level ""Design"" activity. So the first question could be: is this a bug? Should the project-specific activity no longer exist when it has been reactivated? For the moment, I'll assume that it is reasonable that it continues to exist.

So, now I make a request to the REST API to get an enumeration of the time entry activities (GET /enumerations/time_entry_activities.xml). It returns only the system-level time entry activities.

However, if I use the web interface to submit a time entry on the ""Design"" activity for my project via the web interface, it uses the project-specific ID for the time entry.

This inconsistency between the behavior exposed via the REST API and the web interface means that I'm unable to submit time entries via the REST API for project-specific activities, because the REST API does not give me the IDs of those activities.

In order to resolve the bug, I would propose to modify the code that adds time entries in order to converts a system-level time entry activity ID to the corresponding project-specific time entry activity ID if it exists. I've attached a proposed patch.

There is logic deficiency in deriving the tier type for the same DIGI calls.  Based on my limited knowledge, we are deriving destination_group based on Country + PSTN and Country + MOB. Assume we have a destination called xxxxxxx . Mobile xxxxxxx, we will derive the destination group as JAMMOB. Now, I need to tagged this group to DIGI tier type. Similarly for xxxxxxx . Mobile Others, I will derive the destination group as JAMMOB but I need to tagged this to NGE_TRA tier type. Additionally, for xxxxxxx . PSTN, we will derive group as JAMPSTN and need to tagged them to NGE_TRA tier type. In the xxxxxxx . Mobile xxxxxxx and xxxxxxx . Mobile Other scenario, based on current table structure, I will not be able to tagged them with different tier type. I have to settle down with DIGI or NGE_TRA. This will not work well for onward reporting. Please look into this so that we can cover the requirements.

This can lead to security issues. For example i entered ""/"" as path to a redmine project and i was able to see and modify  all of the server root (linux) in which the application runs. (Such behaviour can be replicated in windows hosts by entering ""C:/"" into path).

So a folder definition for all repositories must be set in a config file (not via admin panel because it  must not be changed). So that whatever path is entered, the root path will be the one set in config file.

I think this is a serious security issue.

You can see screenshots for information.

I thought I had merely forgot to attach them; however, upon repeating my edit due to needing to remake all the files I learned that redmine has a hard limit of 10 files attached per edit.

Although I'm not sure why this limit exists (I'll be adding another issue to make this a setting or remove it) redmine should definitely alert the end user to the limit both beforehand such as like the the text for max file size is displayed as well as after an attempt to add more than 10 files is added (javascript alert box or something similar).

But this is a general problem, probably related to this: #3957

The redmine was updated to most recent official version few days ago, and a problem occurred with file uploader.

1) If the ""add file"" button is not clicked, the file should be deleted from the server.

2) It starts uploading a file after selecting the file, and not after deciding to create the ticket (in earlier version, the file was uploaded after final confirmation on ticket).

Doesn't seem to be configurable, and you cannot cancel a file once it's been uploaded (so it will use server space, even if you don't click the ""add"" button."

But we'd like to have something more: an opportunity to change issue for several spent time entries simultaneously. So, how it could behave: on page with issue's time entries change select checkboxes near several entries and then click edit button. If we change issue number at the next page (issue editor), then other selected entries have to change their issue number. It seems logically clear behaviour.

Also it were really good if we could edit user field of spent time entry on issue editor page. It should be just new field on the form (there is no user field on form now). But I'm not sure, would there be another feature request?"

We created a custom field named ""Tester"" and its format is ""User"". When somebody tests an issue that we've marked *resolved*, they set themselves as the tester. 

This works very well for us because I can search for all the issues for which I am a tester. It fails though, when an employee leaves the company and we lock the user account. From that point on, any edits to the bug will reset our custom *Tester* field and make it empty.

i'm attempting to perform what i call data-interferometry on simultaneous processing of split analog signal with two dongles driven by GRC. at one point, as if by magic, both dongles were gathering data simultaneously with one processing real dish signal while the other had no physical connection; a visible discernable difference was detected over many hours of intense observation. here are the image captures of when it normally is not working:
https://www.msu.edu/~micheal/usb-devices.png
https://www.msu.edu/~micheal/dongle-control-diagram.png
https://www.msu.edu/~micheal/output.png
the 1st image is of the attached USB devices to this Linux computer.
the 2nd image is the GRC flow-diagram associated with this endeavor.
the 3rd image reflects the typical non-working output of the SDR processes.

again, the strange factor is that it worked at one point producing waterfall for both dongles .. any positive attention or assistance will be greatly appreciated.

Even if the notifcation Settings are: ""Only for things I watch or I'm involved in"" no notification is sent.

For me ""involved"" means, that you should get notifications when you commented an issue (right?). Thus, no need to add yourself to the watchers list.

I have a redmine installation that serves both the developer teams (2 different agile team) and some customers.
Using both native visibility workflow in redmine and after creates some cutom plugin I can control with great granularity visibility\mandatory field on developer side and on customer side for all projects.
I have encountered only one problem and this is related to roadmap management: I have multi-projects shared version, because I use version to define sprint and project-backlog.
The problem I have encountered is that also if I can hide private bug of projects to my customers, I cannot hide the shared roadmap.
This for me is a defect because redmine should be more, nativilly, more scrum oriented.
(I see a lot of plugins but none of them match my requirement)

Thanks in advance.

18754,Redmine,Defect,NA,New,Normal,empty svn logentry crashes revision batch reading,Micha? Kr?l,NA,2018-01-03T12:10:00Z,SCM,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,2015-01-05T14:02:00Z,NA,NA,NA,NA,"If svn xml log contains logentry without data the revision reading is interruped and no error message is written to redmine logs.

Revisions are read from xml returned from command:
<pre>
svn log --xml ...
</pre>

Example:
<pre><code class=""xml"">
<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8""?>
<log>
<logentry
   revision=""2178"">
<author>mkrol</author>
<date>2015-01-02T06:24:51.507749Z</date>
<msg>test commit</msg>
</logentry>
<logentry
   revision=""2177"">
</logentry>
...
</code></pre>

@logentry@ for revision 2177 is empty - there is no @author@, @msg@ and @date@ tags.
But the code assumes that @revision@, @date@ and @msg@ exist in @logentry@. 
This is the code from @lib/redmine/scm/adapters/subversion_adapter.rb@, lines 175-196:
<pre><code class=""ruby"">
            begin
              doc = parse_xml(output)
              each_xml_element(doc['log'], 'logentry') do |logentry|

               (...)

                revisions << Revision.new({:identifier => logentry['revision'],
                              :author => (logentry['author'] ? logentry['author']['__content__'] : """"),
                              :time => Time.parse(logentry['date']['__content__'].to_s).localtime,
                              :message => logentry['msg']['__content__'],
                              :paths => paths
                            })
              end
            rescue
            end
</code></pre>

If @<msg>@ does not exist the @logentry['msg']@ returns @nil@. The call @logentry['msg']['__content__']@ becomes @nil['__content__']@  and exception is thrown (then it is ignored and it is ignored outside loop...).

The existing of @logentry['author']@ is checked before reading @logentry['author']['__content__']@. It should be done before reading @date@ and @msg@ also. For example:
<pre><code class=""ruby"">
                revisions << Revision.new({:identifier => logentry['revision'],
                              :author => (logentry['author'] ? logentry['author']['__content__'] : """"),
                              :time => (logentry['date'] ? Time.parse(logentry['date']['__content__'].to_s).localtime : nil),
                              :message => (logentry['msg'] ? logentry['msg']['__content__'] : """"),
                              :paths => paths
                            })
</code></pre>

Why there are empty revisions in svn log? This is when revision has only files which are not visible for user performing @svn log@ command. Propably it's a rare case.

I know this points out to permissions problem, but I double checked and re-applied proper permissions and this keeps on happening, even when running the command under administrator user.

Does anyone encountered this in the past or have any idea on how to solve this?

Thanks in advance,
Eitan."

# choose a parent project that has sub-projects, click in Issues
# by default, six columns are shown
# expand options -> choose ""Project"" -> click right arrow to move it to ""Selected Columns""
# click the double up arrow (or click single up arrow multiple times) to move ""Project"" to the top of ""Selected Columns""
# click Apply

Expected: seven columns with ""Project"" being the first column after the issue id.

Result: only the Project column stays selected.  The page, when it returns, has a column for Project and the issue id, but all the other columns are no longer displayed.

After more digging, its worse than just moving it to the top.  Every time you move a column up in ""Selected Columns"" you lose the columns under it as selected when you click apply.

The CustomField had the format Redmine::FieldFormat::IntFormat.
The new value was a true Integer: 1
But the value was refused with the message that it's not a Number!

The Reason is, that Redmine::FieldFormat::IntFormat validates the value with RegExp:

 value =~ /^[+-]?\d+$/

I understand, that ""normally"" values of custom fields will be set via forms

* Confirmed (field ""assignee"" read-only and empty) -> Assigned (field ""assignee"" required),
* Assigned -> Confirmed (same field constraints).

My idea was to restrict Assignee change only in transition *to* status Assigned. Sometimes developers take issues that are not meant to be taken. We have ""Not assigned"" project version, ""Platform"" category and tracker ""Info"", if either of them is set an issue is considered just for information (subtasks status, etc.), not to be acted upon.

The problem is that I can't unassign them and go back to status Confirmed because when I do that only status changes, Assignee remains set (field disappears after selecting Confirmed status from @<select>@). In Confirmed status I can't unassign user because field won't show up or Redmine will complain of field being read only.

I think that not unassigning user looks like a bug, but maybe I'm unaware of achieving desired result."

Unfortunately, the Redmine::Activity. Fetcher (lib/redmine/activity/fetcher.rb) method, line 41, requires that permission be called the event type name with ""view_"" added to the front.

So, if I added the event type :dmsf_file_revision_accesses then there needs to be a permission called :view_dmsf_file_revision_accesses.

If this permission does not exist, the filter on the right hand side of the activity stream will be missing even though the permission works for the stream itself.

This does not seem to be documented anywhere and is not expected behaviour as the permission is declared as part of the acts_as_activity_provider call.

(see #18894-5 ).

In the query with ""Group results by"" a boolean filed, both ""No"" and ""(blank, or to say, not specified)"" are grouped under same name (label) of ""none"" collapse/expand indicator lines.
This happens if the boolean field is not defined as ""required"".

Boolean field which is not defined as ""required"" contains 3 values, ""Yes"", ""No"" and ""(blank, or to say, not specified)"", so it is better to be grouped in different label names.

Could it be changed the label of ""none"" for ""(blank, or to say, not specified)"" value to the other one ?
The candidate strings are ""null"", ""No Value"", or""(blank)"".

* Notes on translation
I am afraid translation texts may be affected when changing the label text strings. For example, ""none"" is translated to ""なし"" in Japanese. If the string is ""null"", it may be translated to ""空"".

18921,Redmine,Defect,NA,New,Normal,Changing Tracker w/o Boolean to the one w/Boolean ignores default value of Boolean custom field definition.,kaz k,NA,2015-01-21T09:41:00Z,Custom fields,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,2015-01-21T09:26:00Z,NA,NA,NA,2.5.0,"Suppose there are 2 trackers. One (called as A) does *not* have the boolean custom field. The other (called as B) has the boolean custom field.
There is a ticket in the tracker in the tracker A.
When the ticket in tracker A (without the boolean field used) is moved to tracker B (which has the boolean field) while editing the ticket, the boolean field appears in the editing screen (good), but the default value of the boolean field is ignored :-(.
Regardless of the default definition, initial value of the boolean field is as follows.
# Boolean with ""Required"" - Yes
# Boolean without ""Required"" - (null, blank)

It is misleading if the default value of the boolean is ""No"", for example. 
* Users rely on the default value of the boolean of ""No"" and may not take much care the field value because they know the default value is ""No"".
** ""No"" is set initially when they create the ticket in Tracker B . 
* If the user changes the tracker in tracker A to tracker B, does not check the value carefully, and submits the update, the ticket has the value of ""Yes"" which is not intended so.

It is better to assign the default value as an initial value in this case.

I evaluated combinations of the boolean value definitions and behavior of changing the tracker. Details are to be added in the note in this ticket.

I am afraid that the same phenomena happens if a boolean field is added to the tracker then edit existing tickets, because the existing tickets don't have the boolean value before adding it.

But if I try to call any other REST API functions everything works perfect:

Example http://server.domain/redmine/projects/1/issues.json?key=my_key returns with all issues from project id=1

I have tried the users API as well it worked.

I have tried also with other versions (2.3-stable, 2.4-stable, 2.5-stable and 2.6-stable) the situation is exatle the same.

I have installed everything with SVN checkout and the suggested building procedure.
All of the functionality in redmine works perfect only this REST_API is not available.

Why is it important? Because I have started to use the redmineNB plugin for netbeans and it gives me also the page not found message of course and there is no category info of course. First I was thinking a plugin bug but when I called the REST API manually I have realized that Page Not found answer is real.

I have checked also the rake route definitions and it gave me good result.

It happens because of collapse_adjacent_encodings function.
I don't know Ruby so I can not explain exactly what is wrong with the code, but I do know that 2 lines like this
=?UTF-8?B?0J/RgNC+0YjRgyDRgNCw0LfQvtCx0YDQsNGC0YzRgdGPINC4IA==?= 
=?UTF-8?B?0L/RgNC40L3Rj9GC0Ywg0YHRgNC+0YfQvdGL0LUg0LzQtdGA0YssINCyIA==?= 
can NOT be joined together as commentary to the function says.
Cause if you try to decode from base64 concatenation of this strings the result will be decoded first string, not the concatenation of decoded first and second strings (decode(str1+str2)=decode(str1) and decode(str1+str2)!=decode(str1)+decode(str2) as you would assume). I believe it's because the base64 decoding function ignores everything after '=' symbol. ('=' or '==' in base64 strings are added when last octet decodes to 2 or 1 bytes correspondingly)

The problem we have encountered is that from time to time issue creation fails because of DB deadlocks.
To reproduce this we created a python script that would start 7 threads and fire POST requests to create new issues in Redmine. Pretty soon 6 out of 7 threads were dead because of deadlocks on issue validation. 

@TinyTds::Error: Transaction (Process ID 227) was deadlocked on lock resources with another process and has been chosen as the deadlock victim. Rerun the transaction.: EXEC sp_executesql N'SELECT [issues].* FROM [issues] WHERE [issues].[parent_id] = 22244 ORDER BY [lft] ASC'
  Issue Load (5027.7ms)  EXEC sp_executesql N'SELECT [issues].* FROM [issues] WHERE [issues].[parent_id] = 22244 ORDER BY [lft] ASC'@

After that we turned on READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT option in DB that allows to read transaction data even if it hasn't been committed yet, and this helped us move one step forward: deadlocks began to happen on INSERTs when new issues were to be created. Still it didn't help to solve the problem.

Is it possible to soften lock conditions or reduce transaction sizes as obviously concurrency suffers from that?"

Is the bug mysql-related ? I am convinced by the test test_index_should_allow_timestamp_filtering that it should work.

h2. Updated-on for related tickets

Another related thing, but I think it is an usage issue from my part : updated_on for issues that are related to other issues is not updated when new related issues are connected.

Eg my use case is : I would like to list ""Macro"" issues by desc date, with my ""macro"" Issue date depending on when   a ticket was added as related to my Macro issue, and not when the macro Issue was last edited.

19091,Redmine,Defect,NA,Closed,Normal,SCM integration broken with JRuby (partial fix),Matthew Bloch,NA,2015-05-13T04:02:00Z,SCM,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,2015-02-12T01:19:00Z,2015-05-13T04:02:00Z,NA,Wont fix,2.6.1,"When running Redmine (2.6.1) under JRuby (1.7.19), the SCM integration is broken due to a long-standing problem with JRuby and IO.popen's ""r+"" mode (described at https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/779).  

It shows up in the front-end as a 500 error and the external command reporting ""Bad file descriptor"".

As far as I understand it this can't be fixed without some changes to Java, but we can avoid triggering the bug by not using the r+ mode unnecessarily.

In lib/redmine/scm/adapters/abstract_adapter.rb:254 in the ""shellout"" method we have this code:

            mode = ""r+""
            IO.popen(cmd, mode) do |io|
              io.set_encoding(""ASCII-8BIT"") if io.respond_to?(:set_encoding)
              io.close_write unless options[:write_stdin]
              block.call(io) if block_given?
            end

but we can avoid the JRuby bug in many situations by changing this to:

            mode = options[:write_stdin] ? ""r+"" : ""r""
            IO.popen(cmd, mode) do |io|
              io.set_encoding(""ASCII-8BIT"") if io.respond_to?(:set_encoding)
              block.call(io) if block_given?
            end

i.e. not using ""r+"" mode when we don't need to - I think this code is equivalent.

As far as I can tell only GitAdapter.revisions needs the :write_stdin option, and we could eliminate that one usage by pushing all the revisions onto the command line instead.

I hope that makes sense."

19117,Redmine,Defect,NA,Closed,High,XSS Vulnerability in Flash rendering,Jan from Planio www.plan.io,NA,2015-12-07T10:00:00Z,Security,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,2015-02-16T21:31:00Z,2015-10-07T21:32:00Z,NA,Fixed,NA,"h3. Summary


There one one confirmed and several potential XSS vulnerabilities in
Redmine's flash rendering.

h3. Description

When rendering flash messages, Redmine unconditionally marks the
rendered messages as html_safe. This leads to all html special
characters in the flash message to be rendered as HTML unless they are
manually escaped beforehand.

In several places in Redmine, the message is not sufficiently escaped
and allows the rendering of raw, user-supplied values.

Example exploit:

Given a user with the following string configured as the email address
(which is accepted by the mail validations):

    ""><script>alert('Vulnerable!')</script>""a@a.bc

When that user sends himself a test mail using the admin/test_mail
action, the configured email is pushed unescaped in the flash message,
resulting in the included javascript to be executed.

This can be used in a targeted attack as a reflected XSS to perform
actions as an administrator.

The attached patch also fixes other places where potentially unsafe
information is passed in a flash message, including an issue similar to
the one described above concerning mail registration.

This vulnerability is in Redmine since at least 2.3, possibly much
longer. It is advised to backport the patch to all supported versions of
Redmine and to release updated versions.

h3. Credits

This issue was discovered by Holger Just of Planio.

h3. Solution

Attach the patch against current Redmine trunk (redmine:r14014) attached to this
mail."

It should take you to a results page if there are search results that match that number

I've created the scenario on the demo site
http://demo.redmine.org/projects/search-issue/issues

The first issue is created and the issue id is 80815
The second issue is created and subject is set to 'Subject contains 80815'

Using the search box if you enter in 80815 it will take you directly to Issue 80815 instead of showing a results page for both issues.

I know that you can wrap the text in the search box with quotes such as ""80815"" which will then bring up a search results page with only the second issue, but should it not also contain the first issue in those results?

I'm also not sure why you should even have to wrap the search text in quotes to get it to search for text anyways.

I'm not sure what version the demo site is, but here is the info page from our Redmine instance

There are 2 issues in Project1/Ver1, 3 in Project1/Ver2 and 4 in Subproject2/Ver1. 

For User2 links in roadmap are broken. They all link to Project1. Numbers are wrong too, this particular user should see only 4 issues, and not everything from Project1 - 9 issues. Links points to Project1 so they give 403 for that user. 

I think that version.issue count should include permissions. Links should point to right context which is actual project. 
Or maybe there should be more links for more cotexts like: 
9 issues   (0 closed ? 9 open) - Project1 
4 issues   (0 closed ? 4 open) - Subproject1/Ver2

In my opinion all released versions should be covered by the table. Like mentioned in the news (http://www.redmine.org/news/95) Redmine 3.0.0 requires ruby 1.9.3. It looks like the row ""current trunk"" already contains the correct data for Redmine 3.0.0.

The cause of the defect is that Markdown formatter generates escaped file name. ApplicationController#parse_inline_attachments (source:trunk/app/helpers/application_helper.rb@14003#L637) expects a file name without escaping.

Textile:
<pre>
!caf?.jpg!   =>   <img src=""caf?.jpg"" alt="""" />

After 3.0.0 release we have switched to this new version to be sure we are using current Redmine branch, and our installation is not so outdated. We are using Bitnami 3.0.0 installer for windows platforms.

We have found a problem, that if a wiki page contains russian word ""Информация"" (tranlation: Information) written with capital letter only! If this word is present in wiki page name (no matter if it is first word in wiki page name or it will be one of the next words) it will lead to ""Internal server error"" while trying to access a page.

For example:
""Справочная информация"" - this wiki page name opens normal
""Справочная Информация"" - this wiki page name will lead to ""Internal server error"" error message

""информация по учетным записям трекеров контейнерных линий"" - this wiki page name opens normal
""Информация по учетным записям трекеров контейнерных линий"" - this wiki page name will lead to ""Internal server error"" error message

All other wiki pages, tasks, everyting works correct. We have run migration two times:
this way
rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production
and this way:
set RAILS_ENV=production
rake db:migrate

migration reports no errors.

Later we noticed, that actually a broken page exists, and we can open it by changing letter ""И"" from capital to ""и"" at the browser address line. We had so far only 5 problem pages, and we renamed them all to use small ""и"" letter at the wiki page name. This is of course a workaround, and problem exists.

To confirm error, we have installed clean Redmine 3.0.0 instance from bitname at another PC and tried to make a wiki page there using ""Информация"" word, mistake is the same. So I think its not a DB migration error, its most likely error in Redmine itself (or probably some conflict with software that bitnami intaller uses)

We have found a problem, that email links to task, that redmine provides within email body are broken. Our Redmine installation is availble on the address: http://10.0.0.1:81/redmine/ and according to this, at redmine settings, host is set as ""10.0.0.1:81/redmine/""

But at the e-mail, link is the following: ""http://10.0.0.1/issues/2460"" while it should be ""http://10.0.0.1:81/redmine/issues/2460"" we have double checked, and we have found, that after "":"" symbol at the host line, the rest is cut off and not included at the hyperlink.

When host setting was ""10.0.0.1/redmine"" the hyptrlink was ""http://10.0.0.1/redmine/issues/2460"" the only missing thing was the port. after we set host again with port, we got the link ""http://10.0.0.1/issues/2460"" again.

that request is still relevant, but I decided to submit a smaller feature request about date formats.

Redmine 3.x broke backward compatibility - the date format used in REST responses is different from Redmine 2.6:

> From redmine 2.6.0: ""updated_on"":""2015-01-23T00:15:24Z""
> From redmine 3.0.0: ""updated_on"":""2015-01-29T10:06:19.000Z""

one of our users submitted this bug report: https://github.com/taskadapter/redmine-java-api/pull/175

if we could query Redmine to see its version, we could pick the right date format instead of guessing... now we will have to check ""are there 3 more digits after this and before that?""..

but a better option would be querying Redmine to see what date format it uses for long dates and short dates - because this is what the library actually cares about.

We have a project called ""Unassigned"" where all incoming issues are stored. They're assigned to a group for processing. A member of that group then takes those unassigned tickets and will reassign to the appropriate technician.

When we ran 2.6.1 with these Email notification settings:

<pre>
[x] Issue added
[ ] Issue updated
    [x] Note added
    [ ] Status updated
    [ ] Assignee updated
    [ ] Priority updated
[x] News added
[x] Comment added to a news
[x] Document added
[x] File added
[x] Message added
[x] Wiki page added
[x] Wiki page updated
</pre>

everyone in the group was notified of the new issue, but nothing past that, regardless of whether a Note was added to the issue when it was moved. 

Now after the upgrade to 2.6.3 with the same Email notification settings the group is notified when the issue is reassigned. From what I can tell this only occurs if a comment is added."

19577,Redmine,Defect,NA,Closed,Normal,Open redirect vulnerability with back_url param,Jan from Planio www.plan.io,Jean-Philippe Lang,2015-12-08T06:39:00Z,Security,2.6.7,NA,NA,NA,0,2015-04-09T12:50:00Z,2015-09-13T16:45:00Z,NA,Fixed,NA,"h2. Summary

The valid_back_url? method used e.g. after a login to redirect the user
back to where they came from doesn't properly validate passed URLs
resulting in an open redirect vulnerability which can be used for
phishing and other attacks.

After the redirect to the untrusted site, phishers may then steal the
user’s credentials and then use these credentials to access the
legitimate web site. Because the server name in the modified link is
identical to the original site, phishing attempts have a more
trustworthy appearance.

h2. Description

When redirecting the user back after a successful login,
redirect_back_or_default is trying to validate the passed URL to ensure
that the target of the HTTP 302 redirect is valid.

However, the valid_back_url? method used to validate the URL doesn't
take some cases into account which can result in a redirect to an
arbitrarily chosen host.

Example exploit:

    http : // redmine. example. com/login? back_url=@attacker. com

This URL results in a redirect to

    http : // redmine. example. com @attacker. com

which results in a request to http : // attacker. com with
redmine. example. com passed as a basic auth user.

h2. Credits

This issue was discovered by Yassine ABOUKIR  of
http://yassineaboukir.com/. The patch was developed by Holger Just of
Planio.

h2. Solution

The attached patch fixes this vulnerability. It adapts the
valid_back_url? method to a method called validate_back_url which
returns the validated and cleaned up URL which can be used by the
redirect method.

The patch cleanly applies against the current trunk as well as previous
Redmine versions (including 2.5, 2.6, and 3.0)

19599,Redmine,Defect,NA,New,Normal,Redmine does not honnor RFC822 4.4.3 reply-to field in incoming emails,Mark Solly,NA,2015-05-10T06:08:00Z,Email receiving,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,2015-04-13T04:35:00Z,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Many modern (or just well-configured) SMTP servers will block a user from impersonating another email address by re-writing the 'from' header into the 'reply-to' header and setting 'from' as the actual sending account name. This caused a problem for me when creating tickets from the email issued by a website contact form. The notifications would go to the wrong address and the user account would not be created.

I'm not clear on weather the responsibility for this should lie with Redmine or Mail::Message but I've patched my Redmine installation with the following code at the start of the receive(email) method in app/models/mail_handler.rb.

If I knew more about Redmine I'd try to make a plugin that solved the issue, perhaps someone else can.

I've verified this problem exists in trunk and 2.6.3.stable.

This is my fix:
<pre><code class=""ruby"">
  # Processes incoming emails
  # Returns the created object (eg. an issue, a message) or false
  def receive(email)
    @email = email
    sender_email = email.from.to_a.first.to_s.strip

    #RFC822 Sections 4.4.3 and 4.4.4 say that if the reply-to field exists, mail should not be sent to the address in the 'from' field.
    #Correct handling of 'reply-to' is required for SMTP servers that do not allow senders to fake the 'from' field.
    #Website contact forms transmitted through a gmail SMTP server are a good example.
    if email['reply-to'].present?
        replyto_email = email['reply_to'].to_s.strip
        logger.info ""Email contains a reply-to field. Will attempt to use '"" + replyto_email + ""' instead of '"" + sender_email + ""'""

- Create a main issue with a tracker which has the ""Estimated time"" field
- Create a subtask with a tracker which has also the the ""Estimated time"" field and set it to X hours
- Change the tracker of this subtask to another which does not have the the ""Estimated time"" field activated
- Go to the parent task

Result: Estimated time on the parent task is still X hours

From my searches, I can see that the issue estimated time is not changed in DB. It won't change to null, but remain to X hours."

e.g. you can have a checkbox on one line and the label for that checkbox will be on the line below that (or split up, etc.).

In the Issue Workflow, I have ""New"" -> ""In Progress"" -> ""Closed"", and you can't go from New -> Closed without passing through ""In Progress"".

I have a ""Field permission"" configuration where the field ""Due date"" is Required, then the status is ""In Progress"".

I implemented this configuration when having some issues already in the state ""In Progress"" with a parent task.

A parent task's ""Due Date"" is the last date of its subtasks.

My situation is I have a Parent issue in ""New"" state , with all subtasks closed and without a ""Due Date"". When I try to put my parent task ""In Progress"" so I can then, ""Close"" it. I'm not allowed 'cause I need to put a ""Due date"" in it, and I can't fill a due date in a Parent task.

@file:///C:/myfolder/svn/repo1@


This used to work fine, since 3.0.3 I do get the error:

<pre>
The entry or revision was not found in the repository.
</pre>

The log says:
@svn: E020024: Error resolving case of  ?file:\\\c:\myfolder\svn\repo"" --no-auth-cache --non-interactive?@



I am not sure where the error could be located. I have taken a look at the latest changesets (http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/repository/changes/tags/3.0.3/app/models/repository.rb) but did not see anything suspicious - but maybe thats the wrong place to look. I am not an experienced redmine developer ;)

* In Administration -> Enumerations -> Activities, mark some activities as not active.
* You can have however these activities activated in certain projects. So it is possible that someone will log time using by default non-active activities.
* Go to Projects -> Overall spent time.
* Add Activity filter. Note that it will let you select only the by-default-active activities. <- *Problem*
* All activities should be shown in the filter. <- *Expected behavior*
* Even if you pick, by the Project filter, a particular project, it will not let you select activities that are particularly activated for this project.
* However, if you go to time report from a particular project, the activities filter will be customized correctly as per project settings.

I suspect that these (different) issues have the same root cause:
* #19656 Activities do not correspont to project when adding time from my page.
* #19657 Can't move one level up the last activity item.

20456,Redmine,Defect,NA,Closed,Normal,3.1-stable/3.1.0: missing commits (omitted from being merged from trunk),Mischa The Evil,Jean-Philippe Lang,2015-09-19T09:30:00Z,NA,3.1.1,NA,NA,NA,0,2015-08-01T10:10:00Z,2015-09-19T09:30:00Z,関連している #11253,Fixed,3.1.0,"This was reported initially by _Ryosuke Hirai_ in #11253-38:
> it seems that issue_query.rb @ Revistion 14406 was not applied to the source code of 3.1.0. I could not find this part after downloading.

After I read that I started another round of commit hunting. I have summed up the issues I found ? and how I found them, using some ASCII-""art"". See below.
I'll start with a to-do section which list the commits that needs to be merged in 3.1-stable, the commits that can/should be merged in 3.1-stable and the commits that shouldn't be merged into 3.1-stable since they are related to issues that are explicitly targeted to 3.2.0 at the time of writing this.
Then I start a section which compares the commits on trunk versus the commits (backports/merges) on 3.1-stable which in the end provides a list of commits applied on trunk but not on 3.1-stable, which I in turn used to specify which commits belong to what and what should be done them. That itself is what I used to fill in the to-do section.
Note that I also include a third 'legend' section to make sure that my ""art"" can be understood ;-)...

I'll leave the scheduling decision (strict: 3.2.0, lenient: 3.1.1) to the committers.

Please note that this issue brings me to issue #18134 again, and in particular to the questions I raised in its note #18134-5 (before ""The examples:""). If SCM-provided merge tracking features are used and maintained correctly, issues like this one and previous #18174 could have been spotted right on with some higher certainty. Just my two cents...

Kind regards, Mischa.

When using various endpoints (/issues.json, time_entries.json, projects.json) everything is ok.

With this specific call, CORS headers aren't added to the response and the browser blocks the request with the ""famous"" error: @No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource@
The call is:

<pre>
/time_entries.json?user_id=<ID>
or
/time_entries.json?user_id=me
</pre>

The only added header is:

<pre>
X-Rack-CORS: preflight-hit; no-origin
</pre>

If I change the param with something not recognized by redmine (e.g. ?wrong_param=me), everything works well (the response isn't filtered). So the problem seems to be related to the filtering of the time entries by user.
Maybe with this particular filtering redmine creates a different response which avoid the rack-cors action?

The correct headers, added by rack-cors, should be:

<pre>
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:4200
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, DELETE, PUT, OPTIONS, HEAD
Access-Control-Max-Age: 0

20513,Redmine,Defect,NA,New,Normal,Unloadable plugin convention breaks with Rails 4.2.3,Pierre Pretorius,NA,2017-12-10T13:10:00Z,Plugin API,4.0.0,NA,NA,NA,0,2015-08-11T18:20:00Z,NA,NA,NA,3.1.0,"The RM documentation and existing plugins use the Rails *unloadable* statement.  This doesn't work as expected with Redmine 3.1.  I have quite a bit of experience with Rails and building RM plugins so please do not disregard this without an investigation.

The following steps illustrate and reproduce the problem:

1) Create a fresh new Redmine:
<pre>
git clone https://github.com/redmine/redmine.git
cd redmine
git checkout 3.1-stable

nano config/database.yml
bundle exec rake generate_secret_token
bundle exec rake db:migrate
</pre>

2) Create a fresh new plugin:
<pre>
rails g redmine_plugin polls
rails g redmine_plugin_model polls poll name:string

bundle exec rake redmine:plugins:migrate
</pre>

3) Add any code reference to this new *unloadable* Poll model.  A quick ways is to add the following to plugins/polls/init.rb:

<pre>
Rails.application.config.to_prepare do
  Poll.new
end
</pre>

4) At this point when Rails need to do code reloading it will fail with a message indicating it expected plugin/polls/app/models/poll.rb to define Poll.  Try it by doing the following:

* Run the rails server and open any page served by it in your browser.

* Edit the any .rb file.  An example is to add a newline to plugins/polls/app/models/poll.rb.

* Click any link in the page opened in the first step.  You will get: *_Unable to autoload constant Poll, expected /home/pierre/redmine/plugins/polls/app/models/poll.rb to define it._*

If you remove the *unloadable* in the plugin Poll model this problem disappears.  Note that a very large amount of RM plugins currently use unloadable and causes this issue.  My environment after performing these 4 steps:

However, the 'new issue' form displays the maximum size as 4.88MB.

I can see three possibilities here:

1. The form should say 4.77MiB, but is calculating incorrectly.
2. The form should say 5MB.
3. The settings field should be relabeled to specify that the maximum file size is in KiB, not KB.

Since I use Linux and OS X, and generally care about how file sizes relate to disk space (which hardware manufacturers measure in base 10), my preference would be for KB/MB/GB throughout.

However, you might want to go with KiB/MiB/GiB for the benefit of Windows users, unless Microsoft has fixed the display of file sizes in Windows 10.

I looked at config/locales folders and there is a pt-BR.yml file there, with all values.

I did a test: renamed the pt.yml (Portuguese Portugal) and restarted the Redmine application. After the rename, Redmine starts in English. 

That's means that even the language is set to pt-BR, Redmine looks for the pt.yml file."

I found Defect #15483, which describes a similar problem.
A quick check in the database shows, that the type for old_value and value is indeed varchar(255).
BUT in the database for the 2.6.0 version, those columns had varchar(255) as type as well, though editing a description was possible there.

Version 2.6.0 was installed without prior data on a windows server with the bitnami stack (mysql as database).

I have created several custom fields that are of the ""List"" type. I have enabled multiple selections for them and so when I use them in an issue, they look like a scroll-able box with a list of options.
The box does not behave in a user-friendly way when using Chrome. This applies to Chrome Browser only, Firefox and IE seems to be okay...

h2. Problem Description:

The box itself shows 4 options at a time with a vertical scrollbar to the right. When there are a lot more than 4 available options, you are required to scroll through the list.
Currently, when you *click on the scrollbar arrows* (up or down) it scrolls through about *2 lines at a time*. This is okay.
On the other hand, when you use the *mousewheel* to scroll through the list, it looks like it scrolls through about *6 lines at a time*. This is NOT OKAY because it tends to completely skip through 2 of the options and I never see them until I click on the arrows to scroll.

On other browsers, the scrollwheel scrolls through 3 lines at a time (the normal default for mouse wheel) as expected, which is Okay."

For example if the following two Fixing Keywords are configured :

Feature --> Testing --> Testing --> 90%

When a commit status comes in with the keyword 'Fixes' then the associated issue is marked as closed and the done% is set to 100%.
If a commit status comes in with the keyword ""Testing' then nothing is applied to the associated issue.

Trigger Keywords should allow multiple configurations per tracker to allow the committer more control over the flow of the issue.  I would also suggest revisiting Feature #11698 to look at ability to set other fields ( assignee ) via the Trigger Keywords. It might also be better to move the Trigger Keywords UI over to the tracker configuration ( leaving the Referencing Keywords in the current admin UI location )."

21141,Redmine,Defect,NA,Closed,Normal,Git tags and branches need to be UTF-8 encoded,Holger Just,NA,2015-11-03T20:12:00Z,SCM,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,2015-11-03T20:00:00Z,2015-11-03T20:12:00Z,次のチケットと重複 #16881,Duplicate,NA,"When shelling out and getting the list of git branches and tags to display in the repository navigation, the names are read in ASCII-8BIT encoding, i.e. binary strings without any encoding. This is basically correct as git itself doesn't enforce any kind of encoding for these things.

However, when rendering the navigation with branches or tags containing non-ASCII characters, ERB throws the following error in source:trunk/app/views/repositories/show.html.erb#L21

<pre>
Encoding::CompatibilityError: incompatible character encodings: ASCII-8BIT and UTF-8
</pre>

The reason for this exception is that in source:trunk/app/views/repositories/_navigation.html.erb#L18, the select box for branches is rendered. If a branch name (in ASCII-8BIT encoding) can't be converted to UTF-8 implicitly, the whole output_buffer containing the rendered HTML will be set to ASCII-8BIT encoding. When the buffer is then appended to the outer UTF-8 buffer, the error is thrown.

The solution is to force UTF-8 encoding to branch names, assuming they are stored in some UTF-8 like encoding. As we can't know the _actual_ encoding of the branches, this is probably a good enough bet. In any case, it avoids HTTP 500 errors and renders something, even if the encoding doesn't fully match...

The attached patch provides the forced encoding. Unfortunately, we can't use @scm_iconv@ with the branches as it returns a new string which would not be a @Branch@ instance anymore.

The patch was extracted from and developed by ""Planio"":https://plan.io/redmine-hosting/. The patch is created against the current trunk at r14793. The patched issue is present since about forever but only manifests itself only on Ruby >=1.9 and probably some kind-of-recent Rails, at least since Redmine 2.6."

But while building a proper example to reproduce the behavior easily I found that the whole list parsing (for both ordered and unordered lists) is borked.

While I would like to be able to provide exact directions to what exactly is wrong here, the more I played around with this, the more confused I got.

What I can tell for almost certain is that blank lines are at the core of this issue. Normally items should be wrapped in <p> tags when seperated by blank lines, but here (at least for unordered list items in ordered list items) instead the current ordered list is interpreted as ended and a new ordered list started.

_I used the official syntax from https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#list as reference, which describes behavior conflicting with what Redmine produces currently._

*Example Markup*

<pre>
1.  this is a list item with two child items.
    -  first child

    -  second child wrongly interpreted as code
1.   another item in the same list.
-  text wrongly interpreted as ordered list item

1. last item of the ordered list

However, if I try to view issues, gantt or spent time, I will not see any of the tasks from the closed subprojects.  (See screenshots)

In our company, we use Redmine for many small projects that are closed when completed.  They become a subproject of a project named ""Closed"" for sorting reasons.  At the end of the year, I must summarize my departments hours for reporting reasons.  Right now, I cannot get any spent time reports unless I go into each subproject and generate a report, or reopen each subproject to generate a total report.

I am sure some users do not want to see closed subproject tasks.  I am also sure others, like me, would like to see tasks from multiple closed subproject.  Right now, Redmine's not working correctly, either way.  Maybe introducing a checkbox on the right sidebar to include tasks from closed subprojects would be the best solution.

In the meantime, if anyone can create a simple patch, or give me a hint where in the source code to dabble with, much appreciated!

See the following examples
* text without a space: some_text_, some*text*

This prevents us from using the wiki to enter some simple italian text (for example, ""l'_albero_"") without leaving an aesthetically unpleasant space in between (""l' _albero_"")"

What I have done is to add a ""Verification"" status to the Issue statuses list.
I have then tried to arrange the workflow according to how the team I'm in wants to work. However, a lot of issues started appearing with what was actually selectable depending on what status the issue was in.

If you look at the screenshots provided, *I do not understand how the current Resolved status can contain the Feedback status*. I _may_ be persuaded into accepting that at least Closed would be visible no matter what status has been set, but the Feedback status, according to the workflow I've now tested with, is wrong. I have tried a lot of different arrangements to see if I could bring order to this, but unfortunately failed every time.

What I have resorted to, temporarily, is to enable any current status to select any other status. I'd rather see I could use the Workflow functionality as it was intended to use.

When a user logs into Redmine from their client laptop, then clicks on the _Statistics_ link from the _Repository_ tab, the page populates with 2 missing image icons and the _back_ link.  

The issue appears related to the URL used.  The Statistics page will only populate the images when accessed using the _http://localhost/redmine/_ address.  When a client logs into Redmine hosted on a remote server, the statistics SVG will not populate.

I have a second instance of Redmine installed on my local machine to test plugins / changes before I perform a change to the company Redmine site on the VM.  Both are Bitnami stack installs with:

I did the following to isolate the circumstances in which this happens:
* Accessed my local hosted Redmine using the address http://localhost/redmine/ from my local machine and %{color:#488F00}WAS% able to see the stat graphics on the Repository Statistics page
* Accessed my local hosted Redmine using the address http:// %{color:#0000E6} _<machine_name>_ /redmine/% from my local machine and was %{color:#8F0000}NOT% able to see the stat graphics on the Repository Statistics page
* Accessed the remote server hosted Redmine using the address http://localhost/redmine/ in a remote session on the virtual server and %{color:#488F00}WAS% able to see the stat graphics on the Repository Statistics page
* Accessed the remote server hosted Redmine using the address http:// %{color:#0000E6} _<server_name>_ /redmine/% in a remote session on the virtual server and was %{color:#8F0000}NOT% able to see the stat graphics on the Repository Statistics page
* Accessed the remote server hosted Redmine using the address http:// %{color:#0000E6} _<server_name>_ /redmine/% from my client laptop and was %{color:#8F0000}NOT% able to see the stat graphics on the Repository Statistics page

I am reporting this as a defect as it should not matter where the page is being viewed from, or the URL address used in the browser.  There is also no settings option in either _Admin > Settings > Repositories_ or in _Project > Settings > Repositories_ to enter a value for the hosted machine name / URL used for a hosted Redmine site.

Please provide a fix, or instructions, for allowing the statistics page to be viewed by client machines.  I would be quite happy with the resolution being instructions on how to resolve the issue with my current installation of Redmine.

In the current version and the last trunk, the Authenticacion Modes that works through LDAP does not check the username or password.

This can be a problem, because, if the LDAP Server is available but does not return any response due to an incorrect username and password, and can't bind the connection.

This patch adds the possibility in the moment to do a LDAP connection Test, if the username and password is defined it binds to check that are correct, else returns an exception with it's error.

I've added the follow test to check the username and the password, as the connectivity against the LDAP Server.

This patch has been tested with the last Trunk (14992) and the configurations of the LDAP Server that comes included to do the tests.

Workaround: making a change to the description field (even just adding a character and removing it again) is enough to enable Save, then it works and the Public checkbox change gets stored.

21682,Redmine,Defect,NA,New,Normal,Documentation for nginx configuration is outdated and broken,Erik H,NA,2016-02-06T05:13:00Z,Documentation,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,2016-01-08T19:45:00Z,NA,NA,NA,NA,"I set up Redmine with nginx as a reverse proxy according to this HowTo: [[HowTo_configure_Nginx_to_run_Redmine]]

For the most part it seems to work normally. Then I tried to delete a project which did not work.
The HowTo's nginx configuration rewrites some ""sensitive"" paths to https and then rewrites back to http for ""non-sensitive"" paths except some paths that would be broken otherwise:
<pre>
# Examples of URLs we don't want to rewrite (otherwise 404 errors occur):
# /projects/PROJECTNAME/archive?status=
# /projects/copy/PROJECTNAME
# /projects/PROJECTNAME/destroy

# This should exclude those (tested here: http://www.regextester.com/ )
if ($uri !~* ""^/projects/.*(copy|destroy|archive)"") {
    rewrite ^/projects(.*) http://your.domain.here$request_uri permanent;
}
</pre>

As far as I can see these excluded paths are outdated. This does for example break the DELETE request upon project deletion.

I worked around this by commenting out all the rewriting stuff and just defaulting to https with:
<pre>
server {
	listen 80;
	return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
}
</pre>
_(In my opinion this is should be done anyways because data of non-public projects musn't be sent over http...)_

The regex has to be updated to match the new path structure."

We have this same issue on 3 distincts redmine installations recently upgrade from *3.1.2* to *3.2.0* (and other are reporting the same problem, cf. news:""Redmine 3.2.0 released"").

It seems that r15026 results in fonts too big in some email clients (tested in latest Zimbra Web Client 8.6.0, latest Thunderbird 38.5.1 and with Gmail). Could this issue be related to r14541 or r14540 or some other changes in *3.2.0*?

* With *Redmine 3.1.2* everything was fine in all clients (see attachment:redmine-3.1.2-thunderbird.png and attachment:redmine-3.1.2-zimbra.png)
* With vanilla *Redmine 3.2.0* everything is too small in Zimbra even though @mailer.html.erb@ is the same as in *3.1.2* (see attachment:redmine-3.2.0-zimbra.png)
* With the patch r15026 to @mailer.html.erb@ in *3.2.0* everything is too big in all clients (see attachment:redmine-3.2.0-thunderbird-patch21487.png and attachment:redmine-3.2.0-zimbra-patch21487.png)

Description:

If an admin performs a password reset on a user and generates a new password ( by checking the Generate password box ), and unchecks the option to send the email with the new credentials to the user, there is no way to obtain the new credentials for the user, making the functionality useless.

Redmine should detect that the password will not be sent to the user, and display the generated password to the administrator performing the reset.

22022,Redmine,Defect,NA,Needs feedback,Normal,Issue shows wrong in wrong parent subtasks list,Lifecycle Software,NA,2017-06-13T08:27:00Z,Issues,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,2016-02-12T15:08:00Z,NA,NA,NA,3.2.0,"To make it simple, I have this hierarchy

<pre>
732
   734
      735
      766
</pre>

I have a Issue 639 which has a ""parent_id""=766 so I'm supposing to see the hierarchy like that:
<pre>
732
   734
      735
      766
         639
</pre>

But the problem is that Issue 639 is showing in the subtasks list of 735! Like this:
<pre>
732
   734
      735
         639
      766
</pre>

From the rails console, I'll show the problem in more details:
<pre>
2.2.3 :001 > issue = Issue.find_by_id(639)
  Issue Load (0.4ms)  SELECT  `issues`.* FROM `issues` WHERE `issues`.`id` = 639 LIMIT 1
 => #<Issue id: 639, tracker_id: 2, project_id: 5, subject: ""Reactivate Subscriber (RM-224)"", description: """", due_date: ""2015-12-23"", category_id: 2, status_id: 2, assigned_to_id: 14, priority_id: 2, fixed_version_id: 10, author_id: 1, lock_version: 17, created_on: ""2016-01-22 08:53:45"", updated_on: ""2016-02-12 11:35:41"", start_date: ""2015-12-17"", done_ratio: 0, estimated_hours: 7.0, parent_id: 766, root_id: 732, lft: 8, rgt: 9, is_private: false, closed_on: nil> 
2.2.3 :005 > issue.ancestors[issue.ancestors.count-1].id
   (0.3ms)  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM `issues` WHERE `issues`.`root_id` = 732 AND (issues.lft < 8 AND issues.rgt > 9)
  Issue Load (0.5ms)  SELECT `issues`.* FROM `issues` WHERE `issues`.`root_id` = 732 AND (issues.lft < 8 AND issues.rgt > 9)  ORDER BY `issues`.`lft` ASC
 => 735 
2.2.3 :006 > issue.parent_id
 => 766
</pre> 

Here you can see that ""issue"" has a ""parent_id"" of 766, but it's nearest ancestor is 735!

Going deeper in the analisys..
<pre>

22048,Redmine,Defect,NA,New,Normal,Exception throws during plugin rendering,Andrey Iskousnykh,NA,2016-02-17T03:24:00Z,Plugin API,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,2016-02-16T19:25:00Z,NA,NA,NA,NA,"The following code in @redmine\app\views\layouts\base.html.erb@ at 28th line will throw @ActionController::UrlGenerationError@ when plugin has controller with namespace in routing.

<pre>
<code class=""ruby"">
<%= form_tag({:controller => 'search', :action => 'index', :id => @project}, :method => :get ) do %>
</code>
</pre>

A part from @route.rb@ of plugin:

<pre>
<code class=""ruby"">
RedmineApp::Application.routes.draw do
  #...
  get 'projects/:project_id/reports/admin'
  #...
end
</code>
</pre>

This is not the only source of this error, because of @:controller@ parameter is used in relative form, so any usage of @ActionController::Base#url_for@ would throw an error (e.g. during _menu_ generation).

The only way for a while to bypass the error is to *avoid namespaces in plugins*.

To produce an error you need to generate a plugin with controller using namespaces, like @Reports::BadPluginController < ApplicationController@, which action renders as redmine part (using standard redmine layout), and route to it @get 'projects/:project_id/reports/bad_plugin'@.

Now the filter for issues, e.g. status, categories are not applied and all opened issues in the project are exported.

I was confirmed that this problem only occurs in version 3.2, not in 3.1.

I found 2 points.

1. CSV export options form doesn't send proper parameter.
\app\views\issues\index.html.erb line 80
form_tag(params.merge({:format => 'csv',:page=>nil}) a form tag with parameters in the action attribute. 
But, parameters don't send to the controller.(This has occurred even 2.6.)
And so, IssuesController#index tries to get the filter from session data.

2. Format of session data changed in 3.2
queries_helper.rb line 215
<pre>
session[:query][:project_id] != (@project ? @project.id : nil)
</pre>
returns nil in 3.2.

session[:query][:project_id]  is nil. 
session[:query][""project_id""]  has the project_id.

And so, IssuesController#index cannot get the filter from session data.

Basically you have to add the following inside the *Gemfile*:

22193,Redmine,Defect,NA,Closed,Normal,Getting 404 on Ajax update_form.js request when changing tracker of new issue,Alexander Herr,NA,2017-04-02T06:15:00Z,Issues,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,2016-03-15T09:52:00Z,2017-04-02T06:15:00Z,NA,Invalid,3.0.7,"I have a project with a custom tracker and user-defined fields for that tracker. When creating a new issue in that project that tracker isn't the default one (which is intended) but when trying to use it the user-defined field does not pop up. In the browser console it is revealed that a request to `host/projects/<project-id>/issues/update_form.js` is made but the webserver returns with a 404 Not Found. 

Now the strange thing is that when I have created a new issue in that project and then edit it, I can change the tracker just fine and the user-defined field pops up! It is making the exact (!) same request only appended with the issue-id, i.e. `host/projects/<project-id>/issues/update_form.js?id=<issue-id>`. Both ajax calls are POST calls, and the included data is also exactly the same apart from the issue-id being set if the issue was already created. 

I do not know how to debug this further. It does not seem to me that my Webserver (apache) is misconfigured as no redirecting or routing is happening there:

* progress calculation by ticket status
* status ""closed"" and ""invalid"" are both marked as ""closed"" and ""% done"" is set to ""100%""

All 50 closed tickets are either in the state ""closed"" or ""invalid"". So why is there a difference between ""closed"" and ""done"" in the progress table?

In this certain case, I would expect the ""closed/done"" progress part to be at 50% in the darker green tone and then I would expect for example 30% ""work in progress"" in the lighter green color for all the tickets being work in progress. This was the behaviour before 3.2."

I could not find any pattern, on some teammembers it works, others[me] get tons of closed ticket notifications. It seems to be related to the tickets somehow. The tickets are definitly closed but something forces redmine to list em on this notification mails. There are always 25Tickets per mail report. Its the exactly same behavior as described at #8108

We already verified that it is not related to any plugin. We uninstalled our two plugins for testing, behavior is the same.

I did this in a plugin by overriding app/views/custom_fields/index.api.rsb and adding and if block checking for EnumerationFormat.

<pre><code class=""ruby"">
      values = field.possible_values_options
      if values.present?
        api.array :possible_values do
          values.each do |label, value|
            api.possible_value do
              api.value value || label
              if field.format.class.name.demodulize == 'EnumerationFormat'
                  api.label label
              end
            end
          end
        end
      end
</code></pre>

I was going to just put the 'api.label label' line in without the if statement but it also takes effect for list types where label and value appear to be the same.  There is almost certainly a better way to do this.

I honestly believe it doesn't make any sense to hide it (if User.current.allowed_to_view_all_time_entries?(@project)), so as soon as we talk about time entries, that's ok to hide the entries themselves, but what is the reason to hide the total amount of already spent time (the value itself) for the issue?

I guess the ""Spent time"" could be displayed nevertheless the option and, for instance, not be a link (a href) to the times entries log if user has no permission to see all time log entries.

It would be nice if you can adjust it accordingly."

<pre>
[1_0_0]             - (3h)

 |
 +--- [1_2_0]       - (2h)

       | +- [1_2_1] - 1h
       |
       +--- [1_2_1] - 1h
</pre>

When I set @[1_1_0]@ to status closed, the done ratio of @[1_0_0]@ is recalculated. 

Since 1h of 3h of work are done, the derived done ratio of @[1_0_0]@ should be 33%. In current Redmine trunk r15582 the actual value is 50%, since the done ratio is solely based on the direct children and their estimated hours. The code was introduced with version#102, r14875, #20995.


It gets more complicated when adding estimates on parent nodes (introduced in version#90, r14272, #16092):

<pre>
[2_0_0]             - 1h (Total 5h)

       |
       +--- [2_2_1] - 1h (Total 1h)
</pre>

Estimated hours on parent tasks are added to the estimated hours of the issue's sub tasks. The total estimated hours is the sum of all issues within the sub tree.

When I set @[2_1_0]@ to status closed, the done ratio of @[2_0_0]@ is recalculated. 

Now 1h of 4h of work on the sub tasks are done, the derived done ratio of @[2_0_0]@ should therefore be 25%. Similarly one could argue that 1h of 5h on the whole issue tree are done, the derived done ratio of @[2_0_0]@ should therefore be 20%.

But in current Redmine trunk r15582 the actual value is 50%, since the done ratio is solely based on the direct children and their estimated hours.

It takes around 3 seconds to execute the whole query.

I think the main problem is with the nested SELECT statement. If I execute it separately, then paste its results directly into the main query, the query is much faster:

Added by shivaranjani v about 4 years ago

I encountered this bug with the latest version and found that it was discussed 4 years ago.
message#31804

Dear Friends,
I have created a issue in redmine. Let us suppose its redmine id is 10. I have created two other issues manuaaly through create new issues and then added the parent id 10 in both of thes two issues. So now 10 is the parents and 11 and 12 are childs for the parent task.
When I am trying to import data through CSV, when mapping is done with repect to the general fields, there in the import screen it displays us an option to select for unique field. Since I am creation a relatioship based on redmine id, it is not being popluated in the drop down and hence forth unable to import. Kindly provide your inputs.
thanks inadvance.

Regards,
SR.

2. Create a custom query using the custom date field (millestone_x) as one of the filters. For instance, let's set a filter where <millestone_x> <is> <this week>.

3. Then save this query to be visible <to any users> and <For all projects>

I've been reading forums and issues here for a couple of hours now and I'm unable to solve the problem, but I think I have a good idea of what is happening now.

After doing the installation in the same server I have gitlab, I did try to make the relation of the project with the repo, without success. All the permissions are ok and the paths are correct, but the error keeps saying the directory is not a repository, which I know it is. However, I did one test. I made another installation of redmine in another server and did a mirror of the same repo in that new server... it worked without any problem. 

Then I made another test: If I create a brand new repo as bare, and try to use it in the same server, it will not work. 

So looks like the problem is only when creating bare repos in the same server. Otherwise it works ok. Do you have any idea how can I fix this?"

* The custom assigned role has _View Issue_, but _Issue Visibility_ set to created and assigned. 

With this setup, the user will be able to see Issues not related to them at /issues, but /issues/<id> will throw a 403.

* without the scrum plugin all was fine

After some reseaches I realized that the upgrade of the database was not processed.
Why? 
* I tried once more:

<pre>
sudo bundle exec rake redmine:plugins:migrate RAILS_ENV=production
</pre>

* same result, error on calendar
* and the db table @sprints@ has column @start_date@, instead of @sprint_start_date@

Then I try:

*sudo bundle exec rake --trace redmine:plugins:migrate NAME=scrum RAILS_ENV=production*

Result:
* no error on calendar
* the colunm @sprints.sprint_start_date@ is there

So it is a doku-error. 
* *NAME=plugin-name* is missing
* I would suggest to prefix the cmd with *sudo*, too

# Click on one bug of the list
Result: Error 500, Invalid query. In the log, it is indicated that there are duplicated column names in an ORDER BY clause
Note: the issue also happens on MySQL, but MySQL does not consider duplicated sort columns as an error.

The issue happens in the feature to be able to navigate with arrows to the next or previous bug in the list we came from.
As the Fixed_version field implements a call back with its own sortable columns, this comes into the group_by_sort_order statement, which then brings columns duplicated with the ones coming from the options.

Note that with a MySQL-backed Redmine site, the effect is that the order of the list can be incorrect in the previous/Next arrows on the displayed bug.

Our Redmine install is set up as follows. LDAP for authentication with E-mail from users coming from AD. We have IMAP and SMTP set up and working, and groups of users assigned to each project, in the project, you can create a new ticket, and submit it to the group in some way. The Watchers List indicates who's in each group, and you can select group members. On occasion we select watchers that are registered users but not in the group.

Shown here is a watchers list where we have a couple of members, these selected watchers all receive e-mails.

When we update tickets these watchers are not receiving e-mail notifications, but members of the project or group do receive email notifications. We have the default for all accounts for email's as ""Only for things I watch or am involved in"". I can replicate this by adding these users to the new issue, ""search for watchers to add"", or even after adding them using the edit function.

The bug occurs when trying to export to pdf a list of issues (on the issues page) with a huge amount of columns (around 50 or more). It happens even if there is only 1 issue to export. 

To reproduce the bug, you can create around 40 custom fields with a random name (30 chars) / format and assign them to a tracker / project. then create an issue with random content in the fields. Then on the issues page, export to pdf with all columns included.


Because anyway the pdf would not look nice with such big amount of columns, we could perhaps forbid the export if there are too many columns (lets say > 40) selected in the export. 

This is what I added to mitigate the error, in app/controllers/issues_controller.rb#index:

<pre><code class=""ruby"">
if params[:format] == 'pdf' && @query.column_names.count > 40
  redirect_to(:back)
  flash[:error] = ""Please reduce the amount of columns selected.""
  return
end
</code></pre>

After further investigation, I found the problem to be located in lib/redmine/export/pdf.rb, in the RDMMultiCell method. So it may be due to RBPDF...

On the actual version as in the las trunk, when trying to create a new description with more than 65536 characters, Redmine answers with an error 500.

This happens when the adapter ActiveRecord of MySQL is used, as the field description is of type :text and the maximum limit that it accepts is 65536 as i explain on the next link: https://www.packtpub.com/books/content/working-rails-%E2%80%93-activerecord-migrations-models-scaffolding-and-database-completion

With this patch this problem is solved as it adds a validation in case of the adapter being MySQL.

24156,Redmine,Defect,NA,Closed,Normal,Redmine might create many AnonymousUser and AnonymousGroup entries,Holger Just,Jean-Philippe Lang,2016-12-20T10:00:00Z,Code cleanup/refactoring,3.2.5,NA,NA,NA,0,2016-10-24T17:31:00Z,2016-12-20T10:00:00Z,NA,Fixed,NA,"Under certain conditions (and due to Rails' decision to hold global query state on models), under certain conditions, there might be multiple instances of the @AnonymousUser@ and @AnonymousGroup@ being created. Consider this example:

<pre><code class=""ruby"">
User.current
# => #<AnonymousUser id: 4 ...>

# Create a new public projects with no project members
project = Project.create(name: 'Public test', identifier: 'public-test', public: true)

# Now, gather the list of visible principals of the project
# This is e.g. called by IssueQuery#initialize_available_filters
project.principals.visible
</code></pre>

As you can see, this creates (depending a bit on the settings) a new @AnonymousGroup@ and a new @AnonymousUser@ object. The reason for that with the call above this is called:

<pre><code class=""ruby"">
Principal.active.joins(:members).where(""#{Member.table_name}.project_id = ?"", project,id).uniq.visible
</code></pre>

Now, in the @visible@ scope of the @Principle@, a call to @AnonymousUser.first@ class is used to find the anonymous user (and equivalently the @AnonymousGroup@ later). Unfortunately this happens while the query scope for the outer query is still active. The new and unrelated query for the anonymous user appears to inherits the existing scope on the @Principle@ class of the outer query which results in Redmine not finding the anonymous user and subsequently creating a new one.

This behavior can be reliably reproduced when browsing as Anonymous a public project without any explicit members.

The attached patch against current trunk was developed for one of our customers at ""Planio"":https://plan.io/redmine who experiences this issue. The problem does also occur in all Redmine versions which support the user visibility feature (that is all Redmine 3 version iirc).

The patch fixes the problem by performing the queries for the qlobal anonymous objects with an explicit call to @unscoped@ which should remove the inherited outer scope. When merging this, it might be a good idea to also provide a migration which removes any erroneous @AnonymousUser@, @AnonymousGroup@, @NonMemberGroup@ and @AnonymousRole@ instances in the database.

24213,Redmine,Defect,NA,Closed,Normal,% Done is not correct for parent to parents when calculated from subtasks,C-O L,NA,2016-11-21T14:02:00Z,Issues planning,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,2016-10-30T22:32:00Z,2016-11-21T14:02:00Z,次のチケットと重複 #23511,Duplicate,3.3.0,"When having more than two levels of issues then when the % done is calculated for the top level parent then the subtasks on the first level always have equal weight instead of having a weight based on their total estimated hours.

Example:
<pre>
   P         - top level parent task
  (40)       = total estimated time
  / \
 /   \
A1    B1     - 1st level subtasks
(10)  (30)   = total estimated time
|\    |\
| \   | \
A2 A3 B2 B3  - 2nd level subtasks
3  7  9  21  = estimated times for 2nd level subtasks
</pre>
The 2nd level subtasks each have an estimated time (A2=3h, A3=7h, B2=9h, B3=21h). The A subtree has a total of 10h and the B subtree has a total of 30h.

The 1st level subtasks calculate their % done using  (sum of subtasks % done * estimated time)/(total estimated time).
So if A2 is closed(100%) then A1 has a %done of 30% (A2+A3=10h, and 3h of 10h = 30%).

The total estimated time for the top level parent P is 40h. When only A2 is closed then the correct %done for P should be 7.5% (3h of 40h), but it is actually showing the %done for A1 divided by the total number of 1st level subtasks which is 30%/2=15%.

I have created a patch that solves the problem, and it seems to work fine for us that have up to three levels of tasks and no more than 10 nodes total in a tree."

h1. Goal

The project field should not disappear on selection of a project, either by showing the field more often (lax approach) or reducing the target projects list.

The file I tried to upload was named *5000540775.HTM*. 
I had to rename the file to *FILE5000540775.HTM* to be able to upload it.

Thanks in advance.

# Activity in ""Project""
# Activity in ""User Profile"" (offical name maybe different ...), which shows User Name, Mail(optional), projects to which the user joins in the left, recent activity of the user in the right.
# Activity History of the user, which shows activity history in 30 days period (days are set differently at the installation). You could go to the past history and come back.

We observed the following.
# Among these 3 ""Activity"", Date/Time is different in 2. from 1 and 3. 
# Compared with the actual modification date and time, 2. shows wrong date/time, while 1. and 3. shows correct date/time.
# Wrong Date/Time is related to Time zone setting of User profile of the viewer, which means who is to view Activities. It is not the setting of the user to be viewed.
** For example, if Time zone is set to JST, ie. GMT+09:00(Tokyo), activities between 00:00-08:59 (in JST) are diaplayed as it was in the day before.
*** example: Activity at Dec.22, 2016 06:35 AM =>  Dec. *21* , 2016 06:35 AM
** In order to confirm, if Time zone is changed to GMT, ie. GMT+00:00(London), all activities are displayed correctly.

We wonder if these 3 activity listing use different calculation logic.

Please note:
# There are several open issues about Time zone, such as #6991, #5425, #5091. I am not sure if the issue described here is the duplicate of existing ones. If so, I am happy if someone would point it out.
** I made this issue to clarify the phenomena. hope this helps.
# The issue happens but, in my opinion, the severity is minor.

Steps to reproduce:

Expected behavior: Site loads or redirects to www.redmine.org

This affects the non-SSL version only. The following links do work correctly:

* http://www.redmine.org/
* https://www.redmine.org/

Suggested fix: Redirect all of the above to https://www.redmine.org/. This will fix both the www and non-www URLs, while ensuring all visitors use SSL.

You should probably keep only one of them.
While it's not a problem now, it could cause errors if you change the version of just one of them later.

I have just installed the server key and certificate and they are fine and https works. But the links within Redmine are http.

I gather from random pages that @RequestHeader set X_FORWARDED_PROTO 'https'@ is good and that does indeed change the problem.

But both the http and https services are on non-standard ports not least as that makes my ""redmine"" user need no privileges (with a little DNAT).

Now the links are https which is good but not to the actual https port. I gather tweaking @ssl_option@ is in in order and changed the line in my configuration.rb so it said

<pre>@ssl_options = { port : 8443 }</pre>

but obviously the syntax wasn't right.

Please could the documentation be fixed with a complete guide on HTTPS setup particularly where non-standard (TCP) ports are used. I have found mentions in the forums but it hasn't helped me.

It would be reasonable to assume the business of preparing keys and certificates and dealing with Apache is documented elsewhere many times over.

24906,Redmine,Defect,NA,New,Normal,Session expiration not visible when editing issues,Immanuel Wilhelmy,NA,2017-01-23T11:35:00Z,Accounts / authentication,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,2017-01-23T11:35:00Z,NA,NA,NA,3.3.0,"h2. Session expiration not visible when editing issues

As some tickets already address redmine's behavior when you are _currently_ editing a ticket and get (in the meantime) logged out, this addresses an aditional scenario:

h3. Problem

if your session has expired, you can *still click on edit* for a currently shown issue and editing is still possible.
However if you hit *save* you will be notified your session has expired. Selecting Back (on firefox) redirects you to the login page and your edits are lost.

h3. How to test

Log in
Select an issue (viewing mode)
open redmine in a second tab and logout on this
Return to the issue tab
Select edit (editing is possible)
Select save
--> you will be notified that your session is expired and your edits are lost

h3. Desired behavior

If your session has expired at least the ""edit"" function should be blocked and user should get notification on invalid session. Ideally the user would be shown (when session expires during editing) the login-dialog with the possibility to authenticate, resume and save the current edit.

24924,Redmine,Defect,NA,Closed,Normal,Redmine installation produces different results depending on the date installed,Angelo Bertolli,NA,2017-01-27T06:45:00Z,Gems support,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,2017-01-25T21:59:00Z,2017-01-26T03:02:00Z,NA,Wont fix,3.3.1,"h2. The general problem

Redmine releases leave their dependencies open-ended, and assume that later versions of gems will always be backward compatible and can be installed with the release.

If you install Redmine on a system using the instructions on the site, you will get a different result depending on what version of a gem happens to be available at that time.

h2. A side effect, specific example of this being an issue

When the Gemfile specifies a version like '>= x.x.x' it will throw an error during installation if the newest version of a gem has changed dependencies.

e.g.

* When Redmine 3.3.1 was released it could be installed on RHEL 7 using Ruby 2.0
* At some point in time, nokogiri 1.7 was released that requires Ruby 2.1
* When attempting to run bundler to install Redmine on an identical system after this point will generate an error requiring Ruby 2.1

h2. Solution

The current/correct practice for maintaining a Gemfile should be to use '~> x.x.x' whenever possible.  This ensures both that (1) the version of the gem that was verified with a particular release is used, and (2) future gem versions do not cause unresolved dependency problems.

I don't know what the fix actually is, but this Stackoverflow.com[1] thread mentioned this:

> The combination of using: <code>@file = IO.read(file).force_encoding(""ISO-8859-1"").encode(""utf-8"", replace: nil)</code> and <code>#encoding: UTF-8</code> solved the issue.

I don't have Ruby knowledge, but I'll start digging through the code on my end to see if I can find where to make those changes. Please let me know if you need additional information.

We don't use plural form after numbers greater than one, but we use other forms for different expressions.

E.g. _hour_ is _?ra_ in Magyar;
[point in time] _x hour(s) ago_ is _x ?r?ja_ or _x ?r?val ezel?tt_;
[present perfect continuous] _for x hour(s)_ is _x ?r?ja_;
[past, future or undetermined tense] _for x hour(s)_ is _x ?r?ig_ or _x ?r?n_ ?t.

Label_added_time_by needs point in time (and optional non-relative times, but that's a different issue, although a possible workaround);
while e.g. setting_session_lifetime needs _?ra_ without agglutination.

Filters:
label_between: _between x [and] y_ should be _x ?s y k?z?tt_;
day related filters are somewhat clumsy in English, too (e.g. _less than days ago ... days_), but I could improve it in Magyar: ""label_less_than_ago: nem r?gebbi, mint"" meaning _not older than_, but it must be followed by _x nap_ (base word of day), not _x napja_ (point in time);
label_in_the_past_days: needs to be followed by _napban_ (base word of day + _in_ postfix), etc."

As stated in the subject, when there is a following situation:
User 9 gets its role (6) directly and from the group's (12) role. For role 6 there is a ""required"" flag for some field.
<pre>
# select member_roles.id, role_id, member_id,
  user_id, inherited_from, type
  from member_roles
  join members on member_roles.member_id = members.id
  join users on user_id = users.id
  where user_id in (9, 12);
 id | role_id | member_id | user_id | inherited_from | type  
----+---------+-----------+---------+----------------+-------
 33 |       6 |        13 |      12 |                | Group
 38 |       6 |        15 |       9 |             33 | User
 29 |       6 |        15 |       9 |                | User
(3 rows)
</pre>
Field permissions (like ""required"") are ignored which leads to a workflow violation.

The reason is that in @models/issue.rb@ inside @workflow_rule_by_attribute()@ there is a line @next if rules.size < roles.size@. When a role for the user comes from both directly the user and the group, the same role is returned twice by @roles_for_project()@ and the condition becomes true. In consequence the returned result of @workflow_rule_by_attribute()@ is empty.

I propose changing one line in @models/user.rb@ in @roles_for_project()@, i.e. from @membership.roles@ to @membership.roles.uniq@. A short patch attached.

Note to future self: @next if rules.size < roles.size@ means ""don't apply permissions if for the field for any of the roles there is none set (inherited lack of restrictions)""."

Browser tab becomes inactive, saying ""waiting for localhost"". Memory consumption will increase, after a while it will slow down the browser and also the computer tremendously (probably due to swapping).

This will not only happen when using the browser GUI, but also when creating a project programmatically (from Ruby).

Last time I was able to add a project was in February. Only when I tried today, it did not work anymore.

In fact, it happened to me while I still was on redmine 3.2, but I have upgraded now to 3.3.2, and the behavior is the same.
Everything else works fine as far as I can see - I can add issues and delete projects, but not add new ones.

This happens with my current database. I have tried with a fresh database - I was able to create three projects, but then ran into the same problem.

My current guess is that this will be hard to reproduce. However, I would be nice to have some ideas where to start searching for
the problem... for debugging I'm running from the command line, but I only get the usual hello messages, nothing else.

If more than those 2 projects are involved in the batch addition to a project, the user or group won't be added to all projects that come after the child project as the processing stops on the error.

25501,Redmine,Defect,NA,Closed,Normal,Time entries query through multiple projects by issue custom field not possible anymore.,Felix Sch?fer,Jean-Philippe Lang,2017-04-06T19:11:00Z,Custom fields,3.3.3,NA,NA,NA,0,2017-04-03T14:41:00Z,2017-04-06T19:11:00Z,"関連している #24014, 関連している #1662",Fixed,3.3.1,"This is related to #24014

Since r15890 / #24014 it is not possible to filter time entries from different projects by an issue custom field anymore.

Sometimes it might be necessary to for example show all time entries logged against issues with a certain custom field set to some value, regardless of what project the time entry and issue are in. If one subproject is not a subproject of the other, this is not possible anymore in one query.

I can understand the concern raised in #24014, but I think restricting the global query to only issue custom fields that are ""for all projects"" is too restrictive. I can understand that there might be many issue custom fields, but those should only be restricted on the project time entry query, not on the global time entry query.

While researching for this I have also noticed that an issue custom field defined in a subproject will not be available anymore in the time entry query of the parent project unless the parent project also has this issue custom field defined.

I propose to show all issue custom fields (maybe limited to those active on active projects?) on the global time entry query and to show only the issue custom fields active in the current project and its subprojects on the project time entry query.

(Please note that the same problem exists on the global issue query and that it could be solved the same way)"

Only if I click 'submit', and receive an error (because a custom field isn't filled out), will I then be presented with the correct 'new issue' page for that particular tracker.

25604,Redmine,Defect,NA,New,Normal,Redmine does not appear to strip leading spaces from new issues,Library Systems Dept,NA,2017-04-13T16:10:00Z,Issues,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,2017-04-13T16:10:00Z,NA,関連している #9588,NA,NA,"h4. Overview

We have a group that manually creates new issues for us. Occasionally they don't pay close attention and will create new issues that contain a leading space in the Subject field. This doesn't affect basic functionality, but when attempting to sort on the Subject field we get back unexpected results. We finally figured out that the issue is caused by the leading space in the Subject line.

Does Redmine intentionally provide support for creating issues with leading spaces or is this a case where it fails to strip leading/trailing spaces from that field when creating new issues? I assume the latter and am filing this report accordingly.

Thank you for your time.

25726,Redmine,Defect,NA,Confirmed,High,Issue details page shows default values for custom fields that aren't actually set,Jens Kr?mer,NA,2017-06-09T05:57:00Z,Custom fields,4.1.0,NA,NA,NA,0,2017-04-28T17:13:00Z,NA,"関連している #9849, 関連している #21074",NA,3.2.0,"I posted this already as a comment in #21074 as this is where this behavior was most certainly introduced but it's probably a good idea to open a new issue for this.

*The problem*

When creating an issue custom field with a default value, the issue details page of issues that have existed before shows the field with this default value. However since the value is not really set in the DB you cannot see it in the issues list, nor can you find any of these issues when searching for it through the filters.

*Steps to reproduce*

* Create a new issue.
* Create a new issue custom field (I tried with boolean and text types) with a default value
* look at the previously created issue in issues list (have the custom field displayed) and detail view
* note the different values being shown for the custom field - issue details page shows the configured default, while the issue list shows the field as unset (empty).
* When filtering the issue list for the field's value (or simply looking at the database) it turns out that the field is indeed unset (neither filtering for the field being 'yes' or 'no' turns up the issue). So clearly the details view is lying about the field's true value by replacing _unset_ with the configured default.

*Desired Behavior*

Imho the default value for unset custom fields (where no corresponding @custom_value@ exists) should only be preset in the edit form, but not when merely showing the issue details. Under all circumstances the details view should be consistent with the issues list in this regard.

I came up with a patch that checks if there is actually any custom value present in the database for the given field before calling show_value, but it feels more like a workaround than a solution.

Another related thing I observed is that, when editing such an issue and setting the custom field's value for the first time and to something other than the default, a journal detail is created saying ""field xy was changed from <default> to <new value>"", though the default was never really set on the field.

Finally, it might be a useful feature to offer the option of applying the default to all issues (matching tracker / project selection) when saving a custom field with a default set."

The journal details are also created for the remaining deleted attachments, but they are not part of the email notifications.

This is due to source:/trunk/app/models/issue.rb@16545#L1742 calling @current_journal.save@ after each deleted attachment. This causes the email notification for the journal to be sent on the first time it is called, still missing the other attachment deletions.

I'm not quite sure of the best way to solve this as removing the @currrent_journal.save@ messes with other things, for example removing a single attachment via clicking the trash bin next to it."

That means it may show data differently depending on current TZ setting of the user. This results in weird artifacts, like:

1. Selecting 'past month' filter may still show two months (some hours which were reported at the end of the past/beginning of the current month will show either in past month or current month, depending on the TZ setting)
2. 'past month', if broken down by 'Months', may show more than one month.

This does not appear to be correct - Dates should be accounted for regardless of current TZ setting. For instance, if user reported Date as 2017-03-01, it should remain the same under all settings, and may only be visible for this month (and not in February 2017, for instance)."

While reviewing/researching #25634 (and in its extend, r16501 & r16502 for #25503), I noticed three issues with the implementation - both pre and post r16568:
# @Redmine::SyntaxHighlighting::CodeRay.language_supported?@ includes internal CodeRay scanners (@default@, @debug@, @raydebug@ & @scanner@)
# @Redmine::SyntaxHighlighting::CodeRay.language_supported?@ has multiple responsibilities:
## retrieval of the array of supported languages symbols from CodeRay library
### storing of a reference to the resulting array in a local variable
## checking if the passed @language@ argument is included in the array referenced by the local variable and return the result
# the array containing supported languages symbols is rebuild for every invocation of @Redmine::SyntaxHighlighting::CodeRay.language_supported?@, ie. for each and every pre-formatted, syntax-highlighted code block (this seems a uselessly CPU-intensive approach since the array's values won't change unless Redmine is restarted)

h2. Fixes/changes

I've applied the following four changes to solve each of the three issues:

* _change 1 (0001-Remove-internal-CodeRay-scanners.patch)_: remove the four internal CodeRay scanners by subtracting a hard-coded array containing the symbols of these scanners
** It does not seem to be possible to do this in a more dynamical way.
* _change 2 (0002-Pull-up-retrieve_supported_languages-private-class-m.patch)_: pull-up a new @Redmine::SyntaxHighlighting::CodeRay.retrieve_supported_languages@ private class method (that doesn't store the result)
* _change 3 (0003-Use-stored-ref.-to-array-holding-supported-languages.patch)_: use a stored reference to the resulting array ? retrieved by @Redmine::SyntaxHighlighting::CodeRay.retrieve_supported_languages@, holding the supported languages symbols ? via a constant[1]
** I think there are two ways of solving this: storing a reference to the resulting array 1) in a _memoized instance variable_ or 2) in a _constant_. After some benchmarking[1] I decided to go with the constant-storage approach as it seems a tiny bit faster than the memoized instance variable storage approach. Though, both approaches are ~360-400 times faster than the approaches where the array is rebuild on every invocation of @Redmine::SyntaxHighlighting::CodeRay.language_supported?@.
* _change 4 (0004-Tests-for-Redmine-SyntaxHighlighting-CodeRay.retriev.patch)_: add test-coverage for @Redmine::SyntaxHighlighting::CodeRay.retrieve_supported_languages@ and remove obsolete @ApplicationHelperTest#test_syntax_highlight_by_coderay_alias@ (there's no need to test through @textilizable@)

This patch serial, against current source:/trunk@16580, is produced using @git format-patch@, which makes the individual patches apply-able using ""@patch -p1 < 0001-...@"".

26085,Redmine,Defect,NA,Needs feedback,Normal,Subtasks are not assigning to correct parent,Mark Wintch,NA,2017-12-28T17:59:00Z,Issues,NA,NA,NA,NA,0,2017-06-01T17:28:00Z,NA,NA,NA,3.3.0,"To replicate the issue one needs to:
* 1. Create a level 1 issue.  This will be the parent of all other issues.  Let's call it Issue #100
* 2. Then create any number greater than 1 subtasks of that parent.  We will create five and say they are issue ID's 110, 120, 130, 140, and 150.
* 3. Now under issue ID create a subtask with issue ID 111.  That will work fine.
* Here comes the problem:
* 4. Move 111 to 150 and it will be abandoned.
* 5. Move 111 to 140 and it will say 140 is the parent, but it will actually be placed under 150.

Looking at the issues table in SQL the problem seems to be that the lft and rgt fields do not increment when adding the new subtask to a new parent that did not have tasks previously.  So, the new task fails over to the next available range of lft rgt bounds.  If there is no parent to that range then the issue is orphaned, otherwise it assigns the issue to the next range available, but not the one that the user desires even though the application will say the tasks is a child of the correct parent.

---

Our current workaround is as follows using the example from above:
Edit issue 140 or 150 whichever you are working with as follows.  Remove the parent of 100 and set it to blank and save. Then edit issue 111 so that it has no parent and save it.  Go back to issue 140 or 150 and set the parent to 100 and save it.  Then go to issue 111 and assign to either 140 or 150 and it will now work.

If there are stray links to that URL, these generate a 403 error, which for anonymous users redirects to the login/registration page.

In our case, we had projects that served files publicly, then moved these to another location and turned off the Files module. The result is we now get a lot of spurious registration requests from users who are trying to download these files, because to the user it looks like the site is asking them to register before they can access the files.

I was able to address our immediate problem by patching ApplicationController.authorize to check whether the request is associated with a disabled project module, and redirect to the main project page in that case. I'm not sure how correct this code is (I don't know the Redmine internals all that well) and I know that this doesn't work for some modules (eg. Issues) which apparently operate through some other method. So this code is just for illustration, I guess.

Our Redmine server is located in central Europe (CEST, or GMT+1), I am located in Texas (CT, or GMT-6). When I set my personal timezone accordingly in ""My account"", time entries under ""spent time"" are not showing up properly anymore. Instead, to see today's time entries I have to select ""yesterday"" from the dropdown menu, and to see this week's time entries I have to select ""last week"". And to make matters worse it somehow also depends on my personal language preference configured under ""My account"" as well:

# time zone GMT+1, language German
** all good; see attached screenshots 1_de_cest_today & 2_de_cest_thisweek. This is what I expect to see regardless of time zone and language.

This has only started after the update from Redmine 3.1.1 to 3.3.3 yesterday, it was all working perfectly fine until just yesterday. I also have to add that this happens independent of time and date. The time and date, when those screenshots were taken:

CEST in Europe: 6/13/2017, 6:00pm
CT in Texas: 6/13/2017, 11:00am

I've tried this yesterday as well when it was around 10pm in Europe and 3pm in Texas, and later also when it was 6pm in Texas but already 1am the next day in Europe. Results were the same.

26471,Redmine,Defect,NA,Closed,Normal,Issue Query: inconsistency between spent_hours sum and sum of shown spent_hours values,Jens Kr?mer,Jean-Philippe Lang,2017-07-22T09:11:00Z,Issues list,3.4.3,NA,NA,NA,0,2017-07-19T10:28:00Z,2017-07-22T09:11:00Z,NA,Fixed,3.4.2,"Steps to reproduce:

* Create two projects A and B, enable the spent time module only in A.
* Create issues in A and log time for them.
* Move one of these issues to B.
* go to /issues, configure filters so all issues created in step two are shown, add the _Spent time_ column and also tick the _Spent time_ checkbox in the _Totals_ row.

Result:

The _Spent time_ sum shown above the table is the sum of the time logged in step two, though the issue moved to B shows _0_ in the Spent Time column. (because the module is disabled in Project B and thus it's time entries aren't @visible@ anymore).

Expected Result:

The total should be the sum of the values shown for each issue in the corresponding column.

Easiest way to fix it would certainly be to fix the totals computation so it only includes hours from visible time entries. In addition to the module enabled / disabled situation described above, it might also be that, with an enabled spent time module in B, but given I do not have permission to see time entries in B, the moved issues' time entries are still counted. This issue would be fixed with above solution as well I think.

The sum should (preferably only if we know it isn't complete) be amended with a hint (footnote or something else) informing the user that this sum is (or possibly is) not the complete sum due to permissions / modules not being enabled)."

On project A, new issues will cause emails to be sent fine
On Project B, new issues will cause emails to NOT be sent for NEW issues. UPDATES however will work fine.

So this is like similar issues I see. I fixed it by returning to smtp emails, but this is not as good, obviously.

I'm not a Ruby coder so I'm not sure why the remote method is missing, or if the logic is correct when the method is missing, though.

The related information is already in the ""Code documentation"" subsection in the ""Code Related"" section. Surely, code documentation needs code experience, but the documentation on this site doesn't necessarily need code experience. So non code related section is a good place to put this kind of information in, I think. It would be easier for new contributors to find.

The most of Redmine documentation is written on the ""Wiki"" of redmine.org. So, that is better to have a link to ""Submitting a Wiki improvement"" subsection in the ""Submissions"" page in this section.

For example,

SELECT MAX(`issues`.`due_date`) FROM `issues` WHERE `issues`.`project_id` = ?  [[""project_id"", 1317]]

Which will make the performance very bad.

My solution is that add cached_due_date and cached_start_date for projects.rb, and while constructing the project_tree, I will use a group query to retrieve the corresponding start_date and due_date for a group of projects, so that they don't need to issue N queries later on."

But if you deselect *all* watchers, the original watchers are preselected in the newly created issue despite the exception that the copied issue has no watcher.

1. The original issue has 2 watchers.

26892,Redmine,Defect,NA,New,Normal,Link to user in wiki syntax only works when login is written in lower case,Anders Thomsen,NA,2017-10-11T17:24:00Z,Text formatting,4.1.0,NA,NA,NA,0,2017-09-12T12:10:00Z,NA,関連している #4179,NA,3.4.2,"Related: #4179

The plugin ""Redmine Mentions"" gives a handy dropdown with users when hitting ""@"" on the keyboard. Selecting a user puts ""@loginname"" in the textbox. This works great with the feature implemented in #4179. However, if the user's login contains capital letters it is not recognized by the regex in application_helper. 

""Redmine mentions"" puts in the actual login-name with exact casing (what I believe is the correct behaivour).

If I try the same thing with a different repository with no spaces in the name, it works as I believe it should (can view / diff files). Interestingly, if I go to a specific revision and 'View differences' it will do a diff of all of the changes in that revision perfectly fine, it's only upon diffing / viewing a single file that it fails.

I have tried replacing the spaces with %20, however this stops me being able to browse the repo at all. I have tried putting the repo string in quotes, however this is not accepted by Redmine as quotes are considered an invalid character in that box.

Having a space in a file name doesn't cause any issues with regards to viewing / diffing, it's just with the repo itself.

The resolution in #7505 shows the repo browsing to be working as intended (like it is for me), however upon attempting to view those files in Redmine is where the issue appears."

-----

It appears the commit / PATCH is not updating the ""predef_issue_status_ids"" fields, but all other fields seem to work as expected. I looked through the database and could verify that *""tracker_statuses""* Table was not being updated after the PATCH.

This redmine instance is running redmine 3.4.2, but the issue also existed in 3.4.1. 

*I believe the issue started when we updated from 2.6.X to 3.4.1.* But we did not catch it right away.

I suppose it could also be a plugin issues, I have not disabled / removed them yet to see if it fixes it. If that could be helpful let me know and I will do so.

Thanks for an amazing system.

After some investigating I found that the attachment in the database uses two columns to determine the matching between displayname and actual file on disk - 'filename' and 'disk_filename'.
An attachment with a special character in the filename (eg. t?st.txt) is saved in the database like that: 'filename' => 't?st.txt', 'disk_filename' => '170926091327_3de45324.....txt'. 
In redmine, the attachment name is shown as t?st.txt but the underlying href link points to t%C3%C4st.txt and on open leads - as mentioned before - to an error 404. 

Now, when I update the corresponding database entry to 'filename' => 't%C3%C4st.txt' the link then works. Unfortunately redmine then displays the name as 't%C3%A4st.txt'."

* the text of @text_project_identifier_info@ (_Only lower case letters (a-z), numbers, dashes and underscores are allowed, *must start with a lower case letter*.<br />Once saved, the identifier cannot be changed._)
* the auto-generated identifiers from #9225

and the actual enforced model constraint for the project identifier (@/\A(?!\d+$)[a-z0-9\-_]*\z/@).

Based on the model constraint, project identifiers starting with a:
* number
* dash
* underscore

are allowed and seem to work properly. This can be tested by adding the following test assertions to @ProjectTest#test_validate_identifier@:
<pre><code class=""diff"">

Despite the textual hint and the auto-generated project identifiers, the above given test assertions succeed without any problems.

IMO there are two ways of solving this:
# change the model constraint to match the textual hint and JS-project identifier generation script ? that is to not allow project identifiers starting with a number, dash or underscore;
# change the textual hint and JS-project identifier generation script to match the actual model constraint ? which is to allow project identifiers starting with a number, dash or underscore.

I think that the second solution is the best, because that won't affect already existing projects with identifiers starting with these characters. I'd like to get some feedback on this matter before we make a change either way.

I was doing some test capturing the destroy event on a member patch and I realized that the event on this patch was only ran in some members. 

The question is, why we have to do a class.connection to delete the member_roles and then run a member.delete_all if we have connected the models correctly.

I proved with this:

However, this leads to all user uploaded files to get 0755 file permissions, which makes them executable (for everybody).

You'd rather should suggest something like
<pre>
find files log tmp public/plugin_assets -type d -exec chmod 775 {} +
find files log tmp public/plugin_assets -type f -exec chmod 664 {} +
</pre>

instead.

Check and update of documentation is needed before the Redmine Docker image maintainers update their docker-entrypoint.sh accordingly, see https://github.com/docker-library/redmine/issues/94

I see that the following is not working:

The issue is that I have the following Nginx configuration:

<pre>
location ~* ^.+\.(?:css|js|jpe?g|gif|htc|ico|png|html)$
</pre>

That is fairly common to serve static files directly and make use of Nginx speed. But it breaks RJS apparently.

Because you have this requests:

<pre>
<script>
//<![CDATA[

$('#custom_field_field_format').change(function(){
  $.ajax({
    url: '/custom_fields/new.js',
    type: 'get',
    data: $('#custom_field_form').serialize(),
    complete: toggleDisabledInit
  });
});

//]]>

<pre>

Nginx sees a request to @new.js@ and thinks it's a static file and tries to serve it directly.

Form submission resulted in a 500 server error.

She removed the smiley face and the issue had been successfully submitted. Then other coworkers created about 10 more issues. The system was running fine. However the failed request created *an open transaction*.

We suspect that other issues where created in the scope of this running transaction as nested transactions. The transaction was active for about 24 hours and was blocking some of our housekeeping jobs and we had to kill it. As a result we lost all 10 issues that were (successfully) submitted after the one with the smiley face in it (resulting in a 500 error).

Steps to reproduce, as admin:

Setup:

- Set 2 new roles with add/edit issues permission. We have: Role A, Role B
- Set 1 new Tracker: Tracker A
- Set 3 new statuses: Status A, Status B, Status C

- Define a Workflow for Role A, Tracker A with the following: *All transitions are checked between Status A, Status B*. Transitions to and from Status C are NOT checked.
- Define a Workflow for Role B, Tracker A with the following: *All transitions are checked between Status A, Status B, Status C*.


Correct case:

- As an admin, or as a user with Role A AND Role B, go to the New issues form, and for tracker, choose ""Tracker A""

- In the ""Status"" dropdown, Status A, Status B and Status C are shown

Incorrect case:

- As an admin, remove the add/edit issues permission for Role B

- As an admin, or as a user with Role A AND Role B, go to the New issues form, and for tracker, choose ""Tracker A""

Observed:
- In the ""Status"" dropdown, *Status A, Status B and Status C are shown*

Expected:
- In the ""Status"" dropdown, *Status A and Status B are shown*


Reasons why this happens:
- When we uncheck the permission add/edit issues from a Role, the WorkflowRules are kept in base.
- In the method used to get the new statuses allowed, we don't filter out roles which are not allowed to add/edit issues, hence still reading the WorkflowRules above. 

See details below

Details: 

https://github.com/redmine/redmine/blob/e8bc1dbaa80dd714254da9c19e4ffaae4fbf9736/app/models/issue.rb#L988
https://github.com/redmine/redmine/blob/d105365e06eddfdd66406c56b5f45dba2fda6769/app/models/issue_status.rb#L66


Options to solve the problem:
- Delete the WorkflowRules associated with the role when add/edit issues permission is unchecked (maybe too destructive)
- Always filter (see links above) on roles for which the method @consider_workflow?@ returns true (seems the simplest)"
