My team mates continue creating lists which don't render because of this anti-intuitive syntax.

With the patch a string value given for @:include_blank@ is not taken into account for the resulting option which will be @&amp;nbsp;@ unless the option @:prompt@ is given.
This means the above example will result in

Browser tab becomes inactive, saying ""waiting for localhost"". Memory consumption will increase, after a while it will slow down the browser and also the computer tremendously (probably due to swapping).

This will not only happen when using the browser GUI, but also when creating a project programmatically (from Ruby).

Last time I was able to add a project was in February. Only when I tried today, it did not work anymore.

In fact, it happened to me while I still was on redmine 3.2, but I have upgraded now to 3.3.2, and the behavior is the same.
Everything else works fine as far as I can see - I can add issues and delete projects, but not add new ones.

This happens with my current database. I have tried with a fresh database - I was able to create three projects, but then ran into the same problem.

My current guess is that this will be hard to reproduce. However, I would be nice to have some ideas where to start searching for
the problem... for debugging I'm running from the command line, but I only get the usual hello messages, nothing else.

As stated in the subject, when there is a following situation:
User 9 gets its role (6) directly and from the group's (12) role. For role 6 there is a ""required"" flag for some field.
<pre>
# select member_roles.id, role_id, member_id,
  user_id, inherited_from, type
  from member_roles
  join members on member_roles.member_id = members.id
  join users on user_id = users.id

 29 |       6 |        15 |       9 |                | User
(3 rows)
</pre>
Field permissions (like ""required"") are ignored which leads to a workflow violation.

The reason is that in @models/issue.rb@ inside @workflow_rule_by_attribute()@ there is a line @next if rules.size < roles.size@. When a role for the user comes from both directly the user and the group, the same role is returned twice by @roles_for_project()@ and the condition becomes true. In consequence the returned result of @workflow_rule_by_attribute()@ is empty.

I propose changing one line in @models/user.rb@ in @roles_for_project()@, i.e. from @membership.roles@ to @membership.roles.uniq@. A short patch attached.

Note to future self: @next if rules.size < roles.size@ means ""don't apply permissions if for the field for any of the roles there is none set (inherited lack of restrictions)""."

I think it would be better to make the wording more clear. I suggest changing the string from ""Send +account information+ to the user"" to ""Send +new password+ to the user"".

On the demo.redmine.org you can see the projects and issues what can you demonstrate the bug.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Let's create three projects ABC, ABC2 and ABC again in ABC2 (sub-project);
2. Let's create two issues for project ABC and ""Start date"" = 2017-02-25;
3. Let's create one issue for project ABC and ""Start date"" = 2017-02-27;
4. Let's create one issue for project ABC\ABC2 and ""Start date"" = 2017-02-26;
5. Let's create one query with group by project name and sorted by ""Start date"" field;
6. When we apply this query for the issues list ? we can see three groups with ABC name, but there is must be only two of it!

I am trying to upgrade redmine version 2.5.2-devel to 3.2-stable. For not destroying my database in production i've installed the version 2.5.2-stable of redmine in my server test. Everything is working correctly (except mail I haven't configured).
In this version (2.5.2-devel) there is two things different from 2.5.2-stable :
- demandes_st_load_test : i don't know what kind of table it is
- is_public field is added that doesn't exist in the table of the version 2.5.2-stable (table queries)

I dump the sql file from the production and imported it in the database of my test server.
Then i downloaded the version of redmine 3.2-stable, I configured it etc.. But when I try this command line :

bundle exec rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production

It fails saying this :
 bundle exec rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production

I have also tried to create a fresh new database and the command line is working, but when i try to import the data of the database of course there is a lot of rename field and it fails.
I've been trying for quite a while now and i don't get it. Do you know where the problem is ?

Thanks,

25154,Redmine,Patch,"",New,Normal,Allow non-administrator users to copy certain projects,Nick Vanpraet,"",2017-02-22 21:11,Projects,"","","","",0,2017-02-22 14:33,"",ä÷òAÇµÇƒÇ¢ÇÈ #4687,"","","Currently only administrators can copy projects, which is not ideal because Project Managers should be able to create, edit and copy projects but not have full access to everything else. The copying is important, because certain projects are used as templates and are only ever copied to speed everything up.

Attached is a patch which removes the :copy from the require_admin before_filter and instead adds its own method to determine copy access. This method essentially checks if the user can edit the project, and if so grants access to copy. The patch also adds a button to copy a project to the contextual links area when viewing a project if the current user can edit the project.

Button:
!new-copy-button.png!

I realize this patch is incomplete (I don't use translatable labels for the button and I should ideally create a new permission instead of using ""edit"") but this is as far as my current knowledge can take me. In the mean time I hope this patch is a good jumping off point for either other developers or core developers to use for further improvements. "

h2. How to Reproduce - Simple Example

Issue 10 is copied
Newly created is issue 20
All changes to 20 are done AND the connection between 10 and 20 is deleted.
Assume 10 is closed on 01.01.17
Assume 20 is closed on 05.01.17
Now create a report including all issues closed between 05.01.17 and 10.01.17

This report includes issue 20 AND 10 -> NOK, completely wrong.
Same error when keeping the connection between original and copied isssue.

Seems that a connection between the issues remains in the database?  Found no way on UI to fix that problem. We're using a workaround with negative filters ""not in"" but have to check every time if it works correctly. This is really time-consuming...

When submitting changes for a subproject while the user doesn't have the permission to create a subproject, he gets an error telling that the value of the subproject field is not correct.
The permissions he has for the projects are Modify project and Manage members.
Of course granting Create subproject permission shows the subproject field in the configuration page and fixes this issue.

Thank you for this great software,

Worst Case Scenario
User login credentials could be stolen in specific scenarios. There is high change of retrieving valid accounts
when computers are shared between several users by double clicking the username field (""username"") in the
login pages. Once the attacker has a valid set of users, those can be used in brute force attacks."

Can I change the ""Unknown user"" error message to something else in case of lost_password promt.

Dulicating my query:
1. Go to the application login page and click on the Lost Password link.
2. Type an in invalid email and click on the Submit button.
3. Finally you will get a message saying Unknown user. With message this you can setup a script to
distinguish valid accounts from the invalid ones.
Recommendation
An application should respond with a generic error message regardless of whether the user ID or password was
incorrect. It should also give no indication to the status of an existing account.
Send an authentication token to the users email in order to prompt the security questions.

I suspect it has something to do with the rails update from 3.3.0 (rails 4.2.6) and 3.3.2 (rails 4.2.7.1)

The parent issue definitely exists. Another issue is assigned as subtask but the other subtask has been added via the parent (create subtaks)

The second Issue has been created as the normal issue. After saving I wanted to add parent issue via the properties...and that failed (see attached screenshot)
