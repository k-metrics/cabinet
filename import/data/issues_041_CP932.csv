1. Create projects A and B, turn on Wiki modules for both projects.
2. Create a root Wiki page in A with arbitrary contents.
3. Click ?Renameg and move it to B.
4. In A, click ?Wikig tab. You're automatically redirected to Wiki of B. This is the first part of the issue.
5. Grant access to A to any user, but don't grant access to B. Now she will get 404 trying to view Wiki of A. This is the second part.

It seems that Wiki of A no longer exists. Turning Wiki module of A off and then on doesn't solve the issue. Renaming the Wiki back to A works fine, but then there's no Wiki in B, and so on.

# redmine/i18n is required in redmine.rb, but row above it is autoloaded by rails and thus both mechanisms are loading it. It is problem in some of my patches. But it is basically bad idea to mix those behaviours. ( My vote goes for a rails autoloading... )
# Redmine::Hook::Helper is in file, which is required, but is patching ApplicationHelper and that is loaded by Rails autoloading. So its patch is forgotten after reloading
# redmine/themes.rb defines ApplicationHelper, but it gets into problems, if there is a patch for it in plugin, which redefines ApplicationHelper method. Rails do not load it - it is loaded, but does not have the method defined. It works only if patch is after a controller invocation, because it load it by path and do not care if it is defined. But it bassically defines the model and avoiding Rails autoloading.

Redmine 2.3.2 till 2.3.4 came with CodeRay 1.0.9, an upgrade that didn't needed changes in the CSS styles. Starting with 2.4.0 Redmine comes with CodeRay 1.1.0, a minor upgrade that came with new/changed token_kinds and lots of changes in the alpha stylesheet, that in turn is used as a base for Redmine's own CodeRay CSS styles. As such, this upgrade needed CSS stylesheet changes like done before in r7618 and r7623 (for 1.0.0 upgrade) and r9389 (for 1.0.6 upgrade).

20287,Redmine,Patch,"",New,Normal,Administration: Using grids instead of tables,Frederico Camara,"",2017-07-05 16:37,Administration,"","","","",0,2015-07-10 22:09,"",ŠÖ˜A‚µ‚Ä‚¢‚é #17125,"","","We are a brazillian government agency and we've been using Redmine to control ExpressoBr (groupware) tickets.

Some time ago, it became difficult to manage the workflow status transitions. In a complex workflow, the table becomes so large it would scroll horizontally and vertically away from the first line and column. Zooming out and filters helped somehow, mainly if the status transition would be nearer the top left. The most recently created statuses would be too far right and down for zoom to help.

This patch transforms the administration tables into grids, so the first row and first column are always visible, like in a worksheet. Also, I got rid of the button that selected the whole line or column, because it became completely useless in a large grid, but I think it is easy to put it back.

Redmine has 5 pages with tables in administration:
* Roles and Permissions > Permission Report
* Trackers > Summary
* Workflow > Summary
* Workflow > Status transitions
* Workflow > Field permissions

The grid itself is something like a table, it has four parts: A floating first cell, a first line stuck to the top of the grid, a first row stuck to the left, a body that on scroll, repositions the first row and first line using javascript. The other javascript resizes the width of columns in the grid."

To my knowledge redmine does not have pages with several of these tab navigations. If a plugins tries to use this funtionality, though, it will run into the following problem: If one tab navigation meets the condition to be displayed, all other tab navigations on the page (even when not needed) will have the tab buttons for horizontal scrolling enabled.
