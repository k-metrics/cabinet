** The answer to the first part would be 'several' (among them e.g. @ApplicationHelperTest#test_footnotes@). My answer to the second part of the question would be 'move them to the dedicated @TextileFormatterTest@ class'.

I'll leave two patches against source:/trunk@17198:

** This patch adds a footnotes test for the markdown formatter (@MarkdownFormatterTest#test_footnotes@).

In case there is consensus on my answer to the question raised under point 2, I'll open a dedicated container issue for it.

So I gave the Reporter Role the issue tracking permissions (inter alia) ÅgEdit issuesÅh and ÅgAdd notesÅh, and configured the workflow as in the attached screenshot ÅgConfig.pngÅh.

The check to disable setting of the priority (and similarly but missed in #27533: setting the % done field) was originally done in the view there since originally, the priority and %done fields were always derived from child issues. That is, parent issues always had the highest priority of any of their child issues and a average % done. Later, Redmine gained the ability to configure whether the priority and % done fields should be derived on parent issues or should be settable on their own. 

The patch, as it was comitted in r17129 unfortunately fails to check whether the priority field can indeed not be set because the priority field is derived).

Hence, Users non members of the project can do certain actions.

The moment we give a user a specific role in this project, he then looses all the rights of the ""Non member"" role.

To me this is a bit counter intuitive. I would expect any role to at least take all the permissions of the ""Non member"" role. Right now for any role that could be used in this public project, we need to copy the permissions / adapt the workflows from the ""Non member"" role."

1. redmine version is 3.4.3 stable and installed with bitnami version 3.4.3-1. (Note that redmine version 3.4.2 does not cause the same thing.)

28078,Redmine,Defect,"",New,Normal,"Workflows inconsistencies when removing ""add/edit issue"" permission to a role which already has a workflow defined",Stephane Evr,"",2018-01-25 18:14,"","","","","",0,2018-01-25 18:14,"","","","","I've tested this on a vanilla Redmine (3.4):


Steps to reproduce, as admin:

Setup:

- Set 2 new roles with add/edit issues permission. We have: Role A, Role B
- Set 1 new Tracker: Tracker A
- Set 3 new statuses: Status A, Status B, Status C

- Define a Workflow for Role A, Tracker A with the following: *All transitions are checked between Status A, Status B*. Transitions to and from Status C are NOT checked.
- Define a Workflow for Role B, Tracker A with the following: *All transitions are checked between Status A, Status B, Status C*.


Correct case:

- As an admin, or as a user with Role A AND Role B, go to the New issues form, and for tracker, choose ""Tracker A""

- In the ""Status"" dropdown, Status A, Status B and Status C are shown

Incorrect case:

- As an admin, remove the add/edit issues permission for Role B

- As an admin, or as a user with Role A AND Role B, go to the New issues form, and for tracker, choose ""Tracker A""

Observed:
- In the ""Status"" dropdown, *Status A, Status B and Status C are shown*

Expected:
- In the ""Status"" dropdown, *Status A and Status B are shown*


Reasons why this happens:
- When we uncheck the permission add/edit issues from a Role, the WorkflowRules are kept in base.
- In the method used to get the new statuses allowed, we don't filter out roles which are not allowed to add/edit issues, hence still reading the WorkflowRules above. 

See details below

Details: 

https://github.com/redmine/redmine/blob/e8bc1dbaa80dd714254da9c19e4ffaae4fbf9736/app/models/issue.rb#L988
https://github.com/redmine/redmine/blob/d105365e06eddfdd66406c56b5f45dba2fda6769/app/models/issue_status.rb#L66


Options to solve the problem:
- Delete the WorkflowRules associated with the role when add/edit issues permission is unchecked (maybe too destructive)
- Always filter (see links above) on roles for which the method @consider_workflow?@ returns true (seems the simplest)"
28069,Redmine,Defect,"",New,Normal,Queries 403 error if query author is not in the roles list,Stephane Evr,"",2018-01-25 10:44,"","","","","",0,2018-01-25 10:44,"","","","","How to reproduce (with vanilla redmine 3.4):

- Go to a project where you are a member with Role A
- create a query and save it. make it visible to Role B
- Save the query

Result:
- Error 403


In my opinion, a query should always be visible to its author, provided that he has sufficient rights to access the project.



How to fix it:
Here: https://github.com/redmine/redmine/blob/7fd04e1f8d36d78ee4f680d0a312c9eac2c65e90/app/models/query.rb#L339

In the case above, a simple check on @user == self.user@ should fix the problem
