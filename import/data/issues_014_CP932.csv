1. ""Close completed versions"" from Versions tab
2. ""Delete"" from Wiki tab
3. ""Reset"" from Activities tab

I've attached 2 patches:

h3. move_close_completed_versions_above.patch

* adds the ""icon"" and ""icon-lock"" classes to the link (the same icon is used for button ""Close project"") 
* adds a class ""left"" for existing contextual class to let the icons aligned to left (according to the #24720)

h3. move_delete_and_reset_above_the_list.patch

* moves the ""Delete"" link from wiki tab on the same line with the wiki input field. I find it more natural to be there.
* moves the ""Reset"" link from activities above the list.
 
I made this patch after I find out that our users didn't know about the button ""Close completed version"" which is very well hidden when the projects have many versions. "

My first guess was that theres a directory of file in the repository that has an invalid char as a name, so I wrote a little script to check all filenames against a regex and we just found a file containing a ~ in the name.

We had this repository working before, so the file must be added in the last 1 to 2 month but the file containing the ~ was added 2 years ago.

I already tried to re add the repository with no success and other repositories I added as a test also work.

We've recently migrated from 2.5.1 to 3.3.1 without any noteworthy problems. However, after migration we started noticing a few strange problems affecting non-admin users:
* Some trackers are missing from project's overview pages and the existing ones have massively reduced issue counts.
* Clicking on ""View all issues"" on the overview page leads to an empty issues list.
* *However*: clicking on ""Issues"" on the project's navbar leads to correct listings (the only difference seems to be the ""?set_filter=1"" querystring).
* Following the same pattern: changing the filter leads to empty lists, which then work after clicking on ""Issues"" on the navbar again (so, again, ""?set_filter=1"" seems to be the only difference) 
* The issues API also delivers empty results as soon as a filter is provided (simply accessing @issues.json@ without a filter shows the appropriate issues)

The admin users see everything as it should be, leading me to believe this might be a permission issue, but we double and triple-checked all settings.
We also cloned the whole redmine instance and removed all plugins to make sure this wasn't caused by some monkey-patching of models.

I couldn't find any existing issue mentioning any similar behavior."

That means it may show data differently depending on current TZ setting of the user. This results in weird artifacts, like:

1. Selecting 'past month' filter may still show two months (some hours which were reported at the end of the past/beginning of the current month will show either in past month or current month, depending on the TZ setting)
2. 'past month', if broken down by 'Months', may show more than one month.

This does not appear to be correct - Dates should be accounted for regardless of current TZ setting. For instance, if user reported Date as 2017-03-01, it should remain the same under all settings, and may only be visible for this month (and not in February 2017, for instance)."

We really appreciate all your work here. thanks for that.

I would like to ask you for an explanation and possibility of modification of Issue column in ""Spent time - overall spent time - details view"".

Could you please explain me, why (started/changed in some previous versions of redmine) “issue” column has been changed and consists of joint information of ""tracker"", ""task ID"", and ""task subject""?

The think that relates to this is that ""spent time"" filter doesn’t offer those columns/attributes to be used as a filter within spent time detail view.

This makes impossible to filter and sort by those ""attributes"" of the spent time entries, which is something that was previously and would be very useful.

This makes impossible to export information into CSV with separated information/columns mentioned above.

This doesn’t follow database normalization rules I guess (I suppose this information is stored separately within DB)...so I don't understand the reason for this.

Could you please make this filtering possible and add possibility of adding those colums separately in the report and CSV export?

thanks a lot
Kind regards

*The problem*

When creating an issue custom field with a default value, the issue details page of issues that have existed before shows the field with this default value. However since the value is not really set in the DB you cannot see it in the issues list, nor can you find any of these issues when searching for it through the filters.

*Steps to reproduce*

* Create a new issue.
* Create a new issue custom field (I tried with boolean and text types) with a default value
* look at the previously created issue in issues list (have the custom field displayed) and detail view
* note the different values being shown for the custom field - issue details page shows the configured default, while the issue list shows the field as unset (empty).
* When filtering the issue list for the field's value (or simply looking at the database) it turns out that the field is indeed unset (neither filtering for the field being 'yes' or 'no' turns up the issue). So clearly the details view is lying about the field's true value by replacing _unset_ with the configured default.

*Desired Behavior*

Imho the default value for unset custom fields (where no corresponding @custom_value@ exists) should only be preset in the edit form, but not when merely showing the issue details. Under all circumstances the details view should be consistent with the issues list in this regard.

I came up with a patch that checks if there is actually any custom value present in the database for the given field before calling show_value, but it feels more like a workaround than a solution.

Another related thing I observed is that, when editing such an issue and setting the custom field's value for the first time and to something other than the default, a journal detail is created saying ""field xy was changed from <default> to <new value>"", though the default was never really set on the field.

Finally, it might be a useful feature to offer the option of applying the default to all issues (matching tracker / project selection) when saving a custom field with a default set."

25604,Redmine,Defect,"",New,Normal,Redmine does not appear to strip leading spaces from new issues,Library Systems Dept,"",2017-04-13 16:10,Issues,"","","","",0,2017-04-13 16:10,"",関連している #9588,"","","h4. Overview

We have a group that manually creates new issues for us. Occasionally they don't pay close attention and will create new issues that contain a leading space in the Subject field. This doesn't affect basic functionality, but when attempting to sort on the Subject field we get back unexpected results. We finally figured out that the issue is caused by the leading space in the Subject line.

Does Redmine intentionally provide support for creating issues with leading spaces or is this a case where it fails to strip leading/trailing spaces from that field when creating new issues? I assume the latter and am filing this report accordingly.

Thank you for your time.
