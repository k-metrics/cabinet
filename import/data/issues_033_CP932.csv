For the most part it seems to work normally. Then I tried to delete a project which did not work.
The HowTo's nginx configuration rewrites some ""sensitive"" paths to https and then rewrites back to http for ""non-sensitive"" paths except some paths that would be broken otherwise:
<pre>
# Examples of URLs we don't want to rewrite (otherwise 404 errors occur):
# /projects/PROJECTNAME/archive?status=
# /projects/copy/PROJECTNAME
# /projects/PROJECTNAME/destroy

# This should exclude those (tested here: http://www.regextester.com/ )
if ($uri !~* ""^/projects/.*(copy|destroy|archive)"") {
    rewrite ^/projects(.*) http://your.domain.here$request_uri permanent;
}
</pre>

As far as I can see these excluded paths are outdated. This does for example break the DELETE request upon project deletion.

I worked around this by commenting out all the rewriting stuff and just defaulting to https with:
<pre>
server {
	listen 80;
	return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
}
</pre>
_(In my opinion this is should be done anyways because data of non-public projects musn't be sent over http...)_

The regex has to be updated to match the new path structure."

Workaround: making a change to the description field (even just adding a character and removing it again) is enough to enable Save, then it works and the Public checkbox change gets stored.

In the current version and the last trunk, the Authenticacion Modes that works through LDAP does not check the username or password.

This can be a problem, because, if the LDAP Server is available but does not return any response due to an incorrect username and password, and can't bind the connection.

This patch adds the possibility in the moment to do a LDAP connection Test, if the username and password is defined it binds to check that are correct, else returns an exception with it's error.

I've added the follow test to check the username and the password, as the connectivity against the LDAP Server.

This patch has been tested with the last Trunk (14992) and the configurations of the LDAP Server that comes included to do the tests.
