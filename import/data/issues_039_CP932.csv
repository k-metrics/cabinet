20646,Redmine,Defect,"",New,Normal,Maximum attachment size displayed/labeled incorrectly,mathew murphy,"",2015-09-14 18:54,UI,"","","","",0,2015-08-31 23:22,"","","","","I set maximum attachment size to 5000KB in Settings, since I wanted a maximum of 5MB.

However, the 'new issue' form displays the maximum size as 4.88MB.

I can see three possibilities here:

1. The form should say 4.77MiB, but is calculating incorrectly.
2. The form should say 5MB.
3. The settings field should be relabeled to specify that the maximum file size is in KiB, not KB.

Since I use Linux and OS X, and generally care about how file sizes relate to disk space (which hardware manufacturers measure in base 10), my preference would be for KB/MB/GB throughout.

However, you might want to go with KiB/MiB/GiB for the benefit of Windows users, unless Microsoft has fixed the display of file sizes in Windows 10.

Hello,

In our redmine we have an issue with adding entries to the time tracking. As we use it in german language I can not give you the exact names. In a ticket and in time tracking directly, a double click on send/save results in double entries. Is that a known issue? How can this be fixed?
I added screenshots of the form and the result when save ist double clicked.

And as the first two screenshots are out of a plugin I added two from adding time in a ticket.

Please let me know in case you need more information!

This doesn't work as expected with Redmine 3.1.  I have quite a bit of experience with Rails and building RM plugins so please do not disregard this without an investigation.

The following steps illustrate and reproduce the problem:

1) Create a fresh new Redmine:
<pre>
git clone https://github.com/redmine/redmine.git
cd redmine
git checkout 3.1-stable

nano config/database.yml
bundle exec rake generate_secret_token
bundle exec rake db:migrate
</pre>

2) Create a fresh new plugin:
<pre>
rails g redmine_plugin polls
rails g redmine_plugin_model polls poll name:string

bundle exec rake redmine:plugins:migrate
</pre>

3) Add any code reference to this new *unloadable* Poll model.  A quick ways is to add the following to plugins/polls/init.rb:

<pre>
Rails.application.config.to_prepare do
  Poll.new
end
</pre>

4) At this point when Rails need to do code reloading it will fail with a message indicating it expected plugin/polls/app/models/poll.rb to define Poll.  Try it by doing the following:

* Run the rails server and open any page served by it in your browser.

* Edit the any .rb file.  An example is to add a newline to plugins/polls/app/models/poll.rb.

* Click any link in the page opened in the first step.  You will get: *_Unable to autoload constant Poll, expected /home/pierre/redmine/plugins/polls/app/models/poll.rb to define it._*

If you remove the *unloadable* in the plugin Poll model this problem disappears.  Note that a very large amount of RM plugins currently use unloadable and causes this issue.  My environment after performing these 4 steps:
