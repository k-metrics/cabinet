A wrong selection of the *Parent page* leads to _""Parent page doesn't belong to the same project""_ error then.

**To reproduce:** 

   * create a new wiki page
   * insert a link with a quote inside. For ex. : [[This is a link'test]]


**Explanation**:

I'm trying to upgrade redmine from 2.4.2 to 3.1.5 (or 3.2.2) and I've an issue with the wiki links.

With the version 2.4.2, using quote ""'"" in the wiki links was working (using the redmine_redcarpet_formatter). 

For example :

    [[This is a link'test]]


With the version 3.1.5 or 3.2.2 the same code break the wiki link during html formatting. The output is something like 

    This is a link&

I suspect there is a problem during the text escaping because the function ``parse_wiki_links`` in app/helpers/application_helper consider that there is an anchor. The supposed anchor come from the html escaped form of the quote (which is &#39).

In French language, this is a major problem because the quote character is often used.

Philippe Le Brouster."

Input: <code>!>test.png! Paragraph with floating image</code>

Output: <code><p><div style=""float:right""><img src=""test.png"" alt="""" /></div> Paragraph with floating image</p></code>

The @div@ within the @p@ is not allowed, therefore HTML parsers will autoclose the @p@, the @div@ becomes a sibling to it, the text content will become another sibling and the closing @p@ will trigger another empty @p@ element.

This is what's _generated_ in Firefox's DOM: <code><p></p><div style=""float:right""><img src=""test.png"" alt=""""/> Paragraph with floating image<p></p></code>.

The attached patch simply adds a @span@ instead of a @div@ and therefore generates the expected DOM structure.

* In general, author and committer are the same.
* They can be the same but have different dates associated with them
* But they can even be different.

The problem is, that if these commits are displayed as _associated revisions_ from a Redmine-ticket the *author* will be displayed with *commit-date* instead of the original *author-date*.

h1. Suggested solution.

The best solution would probably be to always display both, author *and* committer with their respective dates."
