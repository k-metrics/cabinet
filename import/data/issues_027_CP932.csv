But, the *Parent page* pick list is not updated according to the selected project. Therefore, it's not possible to set a parent from the target project and I can move it to the root only.

A wrong selection of the *Parent page* leads to _""Parent page doesn't belong to the same project""_ error then.

I think that the *Parent page* pick list should be always filled in according to the *Project* selection.

**To reproduce:** 

   * create a new wiki page
   * insert a link with a quote inside. For ex. : [[This is a link'test]]


**Explanation**:

I'm trying to upgrade redmine from 2.4.2 to 3.1.5 (or 3.2.2) and I've an issue with the wiki links.

With the version 2.4.2, using quote ""'"" in the wiki links was working (using the redmine_redcarpet_formatter). 

For example :

    [[This is a link'test]]


With the version 3.1.5 or 3.2.2 the same code break the wiki link during html formatting. The output is something like 

    This is a link&

I suspect there is a problem during the text escaping because the function ``parse_wiki_links`` in app/helpers/application_helper consider that there is an anchor. The supposed anchor come from the html escaped form of the quote (which is &#39).

In French language, this is a major problem because the quote character is often used.

Philippe Le Brouster."

Output: <code><p><div style=""float:right""><img src=""test.png"" alt="""" /></div> Paragraph with floating image</p></code>

The @div@ within the @p@ is not allowed, therefore HTML parsers will autoclose the @p@, the @div@ becomes a sibling to it, the text content will become another sibling and the closing @p@ will trigger another empty @p@ element.

This is what's _generated_ in Firefox's DOM: <code><p></p><div style=""float:right""><img src=""test.png"" alt=""""/> Paragraph with floating image<p></p></code>.

The best solution would probably be to always display both, author *and* committer with their respective dates."
