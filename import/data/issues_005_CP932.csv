The green tick is positioned after the label in the new member modals from:

- two screenshoots with the issue

28078,Redmine,Defect,"",New,Normal,"Workflows inconsistencies when removing ""add/edit issue"" permission to a role which already has a workflow defined",Stephane Evr,"",2018-01-25 18:14,"","","","","",0,2018-01-25 18:14,"","","","","I've tested this on a vanilla Redmine (3.4):


Steps to reproduce, as admin:

Setup:

- Set 2 new roles with add/edit issues permission. We have: Role A, Role B
- Set 1 new Tracker: Tracker A
- Set 3 new statuses: Status A, Status B, Status C

- Define a Workflow for Role A, Tracker A with the following: *All transitions are checked between Status A, Status B*. Transitions to and from Status C are NOT checked.
- Define a Workflow for Role B, Tracker A with the following: *All transitions are checked between Status A, Status B, Status C*.


Correct case:

- As an admin, or as a user with Role A AND Role B, go to the New issues form, and for tracker, choose ""Tracker A""

- In the ""Status"" dropdown, Status A, Status B and Status C are shown

Incorrect case:

- As an admin, remove the add/edit issues permission for Role B

- As an admin, or as a user with Role A AND Role B, go to the New issues form, and for tracker, choose ""Tracker A""

Observed:
- In the ""Status"" dropdown, *Status A, Status B and Status C are shown*

Expected:
- In the ""Status"" dropdown, *Status A and Status B are shown*


Reasons why this happens:
- When we uncheck the permission add/edit issues from a Role, the WorkflowRules are kept in base.
- In the method used to get the new statuses allowed, we don't filter out roles which are not allowed to add/edit issues, hence still reading the WorkflowRules above. 

See details below

Details: 

https://github.com/redmine/redmine/blob/e8bc1dbaa80dd714254da9c19e4ffaae4fbf9736/app/models/issue.rb#L988
https://github.com/redmine/redmine/blob/d105365e06eddfdd66406c56b5f45dba2fda6769/app/models/issue_status.rb#L66


Options to solve the problem:
- Delete the WorkflowRules associated with the role when add/edit issues permission is unchecked (maybe too destructive)
- Always filter (see links above) on roles for which the method @consider_workflow?@ returns true (seems the simplest)"

28069,Redmine,Defect,"",New,Normal,Queries 403 error if query author is not in the roles list,Stephane Evr,"",2018-01-25 10:44,"","","","","",0,2018-01-25 10:44,"","","","","How to reproduce (with vanilla redmine 3.4):

- Go to a project where you are a member with Role A
- create a query and save it. make it visible to Role B
- Save the query

Result:
- Error 403


In my opinion, a query should always be visible to its author, provided that he has sufficient rights to access the project.



How to fix it:
Here: https://github.com/redmine/redmine/blob/7fd04e1f8d36d78ee4f680d0a312c9eac2c65e90/app/models/query.rb#L339

In the case above, a simple check on @user == self.user@ should fix the problem

This is caused by r16859 .
I tried to fix it and attach the patch.


**Environment**

<pre>
Environment:
  Redmine version                3.4.3.devel.17136
  Ruby version                   2.4.1-p111 (2017-03-22) [x86_64-darwin16]
  Rails version                  5.1.4
  Environment                    production
  Database adapter               SQLite
SCM:
  Subversion                     1.9.4
  Git                            2.14.3
  Filesystem                     
Redmine plugins:

RailsBaseURI /redmine
which results to URLs like /redmine/issues but in robots.txt are URLs without the prefix /redmine:

<pre>

Disallow: /projects/support/activity
Disallow: /issues/gantt
Disallow: /issues/calendar
Disallow: /activity
Disallow: /search
</pre>

The expected robots.txt must be

<pre>
User-agent: *
Disallow: /redmine/projects/support/repository
Disallow: /redmine/projects/support/issues
Disallow: /redmine/projects/support/activity
Disallow: /redmine/issues/gantt
Disallow: /redmine/issues/calendar
Disallow: /redmine/activity
Disallow: /redmine/search
</pre>

As a feature request, it would be nice to have some additional URLs which I could add in configuration.

Something like:

<pre>
User-agent: *
<% @projects.each do |p| -%>
Disallow: /projects/<%= p.to_param %>/repository
Disallow: /projects/<%= p.to_param %>/issues
Disallow: /projects/<%= p.to_param %>/activity
<% @config.robots_project.each do |u| -%>
Disallow: /projects/<%= p.to_param %>/<%= u.to_param %>
<% end -%>
<% end -%>
Disallow: /issues/gantt
Disallow: /issues/calendar
Disallow: /activity
Disallow: /search
<% @config.robots_main.each do |u| -%>
Disallow: /<%= u.to_param %>
<% end -%>
