25604,Redmine,Defect,"",New,Normal,Redmine does not appear to strip leading spaces from new issues,Library Systems Dept,"",2017-04-13 16:10,Issues,"","","","",0,2017-04-13 16:10,"",ŠÖ˜A‚µ‚Ä‚¢‚é #9588,"","","h4. Overview

We have a group that manually creates new issues for us. Occasionally they don't pay close attention and will create new issues that contain a leading space in the Subject field. This doesn't affect basic functionality, but when attempting to sort on the Subject field we get back unexpected results. We finally figured out that the issue is caused by the leading space in the Subject line.

Does Redmine intentionally provide support for creating issues with leading spaces or is this a case where it fails to strip leading/trailing spaces from that field when creating new issues? I assume the latter and am filing this report accordingly.

Thank you for your time.

Here's the problem

*It should not be possible to delete issue without:*

I think this is a really big issue for a mature product like redmine. I hope this post will help to flag this issue as a big priority for the nexte release and bug fixing.

Running the query without @lock@ first and locking the found record second solved the problem for us.

To account for the possible failure of the inner lock (i.e. when @existing@ was found but cannot be locked) this patch also adds a @rescue@ clause that silently ignores such errors. Deduplication did not happen in this case either because the duplicate was removed (then a retry would be useless) or the database aborted the transaction (deadlock or waited too long for the lock, a retry might work but I'm not sure it's worth it).

The FAQ ([[http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/FAQ#Why-does-Redmine-use-http-links-when-I-want-it-to-use-https-links-in-Apache-SSL]]) says to use the following header in the apache config to tell the app to redirect to https urls:

I know that there are a more instances in the code base where we assume @params[:foo]@ to be a hash without explicit type checking. This patch does not attempt to address this problem on a global level. For whatever reason it happens to us quite often in this particular place, causing false alerts in server monitoring.

This patch adds an explicit type check to resolve this @params[:query]@ case. As a bonus it makes the following 4 lines where values are taken out of the hash a bit nicer.

In general I think it would be preferably to raise an error of the 4xx class in such cases. Are there any plans to make use of Rails' Strong Parameters feature in the future? I think using these permit / require calls on parameters in controllers would catch such wrong types early and would lead to responses with a more appropriate error code automatically."

I realise that simply raising the limit is not a very elegant solution, however 100 is very low, and as we can handle displaying many more through the webui it seems like a reasonable work-around.

<pre><code class=""json"">
{
  ""issue"": {
    ""id"": 15,

    ""spent_hours"": 0.0,

Since r15890 / #24014 it is not possible to filter time entries from different projects by an issue custom field anymore.

Sometimes it might be necessary to for example show all time entries logged against issues with a certain custom field set to some value, regardless of what project the time entry and issue are in. If one subproject is not a subproject of the other, this is not possible anymore in one query.

I can understand the concern raised in #24014, but I think restricting the global query to only issue custom fields that are ""for all projects"" is too restrictive. I can understand that there might be many issue custom fields, but those should only be restricted on the project time entry query, not on the global time entry query.

While researching for this I have also noticed that an issue custom field defined in a subproject will not be available anymore in the time entry query of the parent project unless the parent project also has this issue custom field defined.

I propose to show all issue custom fields (maybe limited to those active on active projects?) on the global time entry query and to show only the issue custom fields active in the current project and its subprojects on the project time entry query.

(Please note that the same problem exists on the global issue query and that it could be solved the same way)"

It's been infinitely helpful as a replacement ticketing system for an older desktop application based system we used years ago.

h4. Problem

An email was sent in with a pattern like this:

  [CCDC #123456] RE: 2017 Renewal

and Redmine proceeded to scrape it. It evidently found the @#123456@ pattern and based on this log message:

<pre>
  ^[[1m^[[36mIssue Load (0.6ms)^[[0m  ^[[1mSELECT  `issues`.* FROM `issues` WHERE `issues`.`id` = 104351 LIMIT 1^[[0m
</pre>

the scraping process attempted to match the new email against an existing ticket. There isn't a ticket number 104351 in our system, so presumably the attempt to find and eventually update the existing ticket failed and the scraping process abandoned the attempt. This resulted in the email being moved to the folder we specified for rejected emails.

When we checked the @development.log@ file (we have our @RAILS_ENV@ set to @develoment@ when the scraping script runs), this was the only related error message that we found:

<pre>
Message XYZ can not be processed

The problem is that existing values in a custom field are overwritten if I add a new value by using bulk edit.

That effectively makes bulk edit useless on lists with multiple selections or values.

Steps to reproduce:

# Click checkmarks of a number issues, with multiple values in a custom field, for bulk edit
# Right-click the checkbox of a random issue among the issues marked for bulk edit
# Click edit
# Click the custom field value to be added across the selected issues

# Observe that only the newly selected value in the custom field is displayed as all earlier selected values have been overwritten

25392,Redmine,Patch,"",Closed,Normal,Change Russian translation for field_due_date and label_relation_new,Ilya Potapov,Jean-Philippe Lang,2017-04-03 15:33,Translations,3.4.0,"","","",0,2017-03-21 19:39,2017-04-03 15:33,"ŠÖ˜A‚µ‚Ä‚¢‚é #25397, ŠÖ˜A‚µ‚Ä‚¢‚é #25349","","","There is a mistranslation for these labels in redmine:

* field_due_date: „D„p„„„p „x„p„r„u„‚„Š„u„~„y„‘
** In russian it has the meaning of *actual* date of completeness, when all is done. Due date is like a deadline, so it should be translated as ""„R„‚„€„{ „x„p„r„u„‚„Š„u„~„y„‘""
* label_relation_new: „N„€„r„€„u „€„„„~„€„Š„u„~„y„u
** In russian it has the meaning of new relationship with somebody, or new point of view about something. So it should be translated as ""„N„€„r„p„‘ „ƒ„r„‘„x„"" to be consistent with label_relation_delete: ""„T„t„p„|„y„„„ „ƒ„r„‘„x„""

I've prepared a new ru.yml file based on current trunk (r16420) (unfortunately i'm not familiar with patches) - please find it in the attachments.

This file also contains ru translation for new labels which were not translated yet except one: ""error_cannot_reassign_time_entries_to_an_issue_about_to_be_deleted"":
* If one tell me when redmine shows this label i'll find an accurate translation for this.


It would be great to add this feature to version:3.4.0"
