Let's start by a small complaint.
Here https://github.com/chantra/redmine_whining/issues/25, it is said that
<pre>redmine now include the rake task send_reminders.
So this plugin is now redundant.
</pre>

WELL, not exactly. Redmine Whining had the bright idea to send a reminder to assignees who didn't process a ticket for X days.
The send_reminders now included in Redmine sends a reminder to assignees whose issue's due date is in X days.
Quite a difference here, notably when the due date is empty or rarely used.

While patching send_reminders (./app/models/mailer.rb) to meet my needs, I've encountered the following:
<pre>
scope = Issue.open.where(""#{Issue.table_name}.assigned_to_id IS NOT NULL"" +
      "" AND #{Project.table_name}.status = #{Project::STATUS_ACTIVE}"" +
      "" AND #{Issue.table_name}.due_date >= ?"", days.day.from_now.to_date
    )
</pre>
for which the last line would generate something like
<pre>
 AND issues.due_date >= 'Fri, 12 Jul 2013'
</pre>
issues.due_date being of type DATE, that is just not going to work properly.

For those interested, I replaced the line by
<pre>
"" AND DATEDIFF(NOW(),#{Issue.table_name}.updated_on) >= ?"", days
</pre>"

This was done to ensure, that no issue will fall under the table during version planning. Additionally to our customer projects, we have one project which is used as our internal IT helpdesk. This project has no target versions defined. Therefore, the validation of issues failed with the error message, that a target version is required.

I think that this is an erroneous validation failure, because if the project manager does not specify any versions, requiring a not specified version is not helpful.

Something probably weird here.
I copied an issue with 2 files attached.
In the copy issue, I added a file inside, I validated the issue, navigate etc...
Later, I realised that one of the 2 files coming from the copied one was useless. I clicked on the bin icaon and then redmine crashed.

When looking at the repository for specific files, the ""Age"" column is correct.  However, when I click on a particular file, the latest revision date is way too old (2 months ago for one project, when the file was updated 9 days ago).

We use Git repository.
When someone in the team forgets to mention ""IssueID #xxx"" in the commit text (or for any other reason), +we manually add the link between the commit and the issue+ directly from Redmine, opening the ""commit"" page, and clicking ""Add"" in the ""Related Issues"" section.

Now, I am trying to migrate the git repository from a path to another, but since +changing the URL is not possible+, I followed the suggestions found around to change the repository URL: +delete, then add the repository+ (with the same repository name).

So, I tried ""delete"" and then ""add"" (with the same repository name and a different path), but in this way +I'm losing all the links+ between the commits and the issues that were made clicking ""Add"" in the commit's page in Redmine."

With this in mind, I set the Issues Visibility setting for all user groups to be the assigned to or created by me value.  This has the draw back that if I add a watcher because it may not directly implicate that person but they need to be kept in the loop (e.g. supervisor/boss), they would get the email updates but can't see the issue within Redmine itself.

So I added two more options to the Issue Visibility dropdown:

# Created by, Assigned to, or watched by the user
# Created by, Assigned to, watched by, or contributed to by the user

The contributed to just looks at the journals of the issues to see if you've modified the issue in some way (meaning you now have a vested interest in the issue).

Attached is the patch I developed against the core of 2.2.3.  I haven't tested it in the 3.x line yet, but hope to soon.

I'm pretty sure it's a bug. This is a brand new installation of redmine with some plugins. Everything worked pretty much out of the box. (I'm using 1x elsewhere this is my first 2x Redmine installation).  When I go into Workflow > Field Permissions to require some standard fields ( I want users to select category, due date and assigned_to fields ) - the only option I get in a dropdown is 'read-only'. However according to everything I read on forums and issues list it should also have 'required' option. Amy missing something or did I knot do something during install? (I'm pretty sure I followed installation guide to the letter). It's not critical, just really annoying to go into the system and clean up after users - make sure that all bugs have a person and due date assigned and are properly categorized. Some of my users are untrainable :-)

This can be an issue if one merges an existing git repository into the project's, if that said repository has commit messages that contain ""fix issue #xyz"" for example.

An easy way to fix this would be to actually edit the referenced/fixed issues from commit messages only if the committer is mapped to a Redmine user.

Hence, commit messages containing ""fixes #xyz"" from another repository wouldn't mess with the current project, because they are not linked to a Redmine user."

My intention is to have New for newly opened tickets (obviously), and then users can set it to Confirmed.

The problem is that at creation time, it is possible to set New or Confirmed.

In my Workflow I have edited:

Current Status--------------------- New allowed Statuses
New ------------------------------- New -- Confirmed (X) -- Rejected
Confirmed ------------------------- New -- Confirmed ------ Rejected
Rejected -------------------------- New -- Confirmed ------ Rejected

For Non-Member users...

I think the problem is that when displaying the New Issue form, it loads the page as having the issue with Status New, so it is showing Confirmed too.

Any non-hack way to hide the Status field for new issues?

Thanks!"

One I'm logged as group1 I can see that custom field, but if I'm logged as group2 I cannot see that field.
I'm wondering why this is happening as they have the same fields permissions.

I have also noticed that updating fields permissions for group2 is not taken into account"
