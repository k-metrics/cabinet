24924,Redmine,Defect,"",Closed,Normal,Redmine installation produces different results depending on the date installed,Angelo Bertolli,"",2017-01-27 06:45,Gems support,"","","","",0,2017-01-25 21:59,2017-01-26 03:02,"",Wont fix,3.3.1,"h2. The general problem

Redmine releases leave their dependencies open-ended, and assume that later versions of gems will always be backward compatible and can be installed with the release.

If you install Redmine on a system using the instructions on the site, you will get a different result depending on what version of a gem happens to be available at that time.

h2. A side effect, specific example of this being an issue

When the Gemfile specifies a version like '>= x.x.x' it will throw an error during installation if the newest version of a gem has changed dependencies.

e.g.

* When Redmine 3.3.1 was released it could be installed on RHEL 7 using Ruby 2.0
* At some point in time, nokogiri 1.7 was released that requires Ruby 2.1
* When attempting to run bundler to install Redmine on an identical system after this point will generate an error requiring Ruby 2.1

h2. Solution

The current/correct practice for maintaining a Gemfile should be to use '~> x.x.x' whenever possible.  This ensures both that (1) the version of the gem that was verified with a particular release is used, and (2) future gem versions do not cause unresolved dependency problems.

I was upgrading redmine from 3.3.1 version to 3.3.2 version. I followed as always steps wrote here http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/RedmineUpgrade but I noticed that the during the installation of gems it required for ruby >=2.1 (I had 2.0.0).

So I updated ruby with rvm and I was able to go ahead. 
But when I recreate the secret token I've an error.
<pre>
bundle exec rake generate_secret_token

I should move on or are errors that should be fixed?

24906,Redmine,Defect,"",New,Normal,Session expiration not visible when editing issues,Immanuel Wilhelmy,"",2017-01-23 11:35,Accounts / authentication,"","","","",0,2017-01-23 11:35,"","","",3.3.0,"h2. Session expiration not visible when editing issues

As some tickets already address redmine's behavior when you are _currently_ editing a ticket and get (in the meantime) logged out, this addresses an aditional scenario:

h3. Problem

if your session has expired, you can *still click on edit* for a currently shown issue and editing is still possible.
However if you hit *save* you will be notified your session has expired. Selecting Back (on firefox) redirects you to the login page and your edits are lost.

h3. How to test

Log in
Select an issue (viewing mode)
open redmine in a second tab and logout on this
Return to the issue tab
Select edit (editing is possible)
Select save
--> you will be notified that your session is expired and your edits are lost

h3. Desired behavior

If your session has expired at least the ""edit"" function should be blocked and user should get notification on invalid session. Ideally the user would be shown (when session expires during editing) the login-dialog with the possibility to authenticate, resume and save the current edit.

I have just installed the server key and certificate and they are fine and https works. But the links within Redmine are http.

I gather from random pages that @RequestHeader set X_FORWARDED_PROTO 'https'@ is good and that does indeed change the problem.

But both the http and https services are on non-standard ports not least as that makes my ""redmine"" user need no privileges (with a little DNAT).

Now the links are https which is good but not to the actual https port. I gather tweaking @ssl_option@ is in in order and changed the line in my configuration.rb so it said

<pre>@ssl_options = { port : 8443 }</pre>

but obviously the syntax wasn't right.

Please could the documentation be fixed with a complete guide on HTTPS setup particularly where non-standard (TCP) ports are used. I have found mentions in the forums but it hasn't helped me.

It would be reasonable to assume the business of preparing keys and certificates and dealing with Apache is documented elsewhere many times over.

Thank you."

we are using Redmine for our organisation and have a central User Directory (Active Directory).

It was easy to set up the authentification process against the LDAP. Unfortunately it is not possible to add users or groups which did not performed a login before.
So essentially every time a user shall be assigned to a project (not to a ticket) the user has to be created in the AD (in the proper group), than e-mailed to try to login and after that we can assign his groups or login to a new project.

This is really cumbersome and IMHO somehow illogic. 
Any user and group of the AD should be available in the project assignment as soon as it can be found in the directory.
I certainly would love to be able to assign tasks to any user who is assigned to a project as well but I can understand if that is not possible.

Though, the users definiely should be available in the user search regardless of any login attempts. In the end that's one of the major reason why we use a LDAP/AD, isn't it? I guess this kind of request is quite normal though I couldn't find any existing (open or close) ticket regarding this issue - sorry if I didn't look at the right place.

Can you give me a hint how to change that behaviour, implement it myself or can you provide a timeline when you can provide that yourself?

Thanks a lot,

Is this a problem with the packaging, or am I doing something wrong?  :-/ "

This is the behavior showing on 3.3.1 when the browser window is not full size and goes to a more mobile or compact view. 

In Edge, the background is white and text is white/grayish and only legible when you mouse over the options

In Chrome, the background is showing the same way.

I have been researching all day looking for a solution to this or to see if it has already been reported.  That research led me to believe that the issue has been reported and listed as fixed in Version 3.1.0.  I am running Redmine version 3.3.0 and am getting the same defect.  

From my research it seems that I am experiencing Defect #10769.

The defect I am reporting is that when I have a Tracker that is the parent issue with a set Start Date I can edit said start date.

If, I add subtasks to that parent task however AND change the date of any subtasks then any parent tasks above that subtask get their start date modified to the start date of the affected subtask. Then, if one attempts to edit the Start Date, Due Date or Percent Complete none of those fields are displayed in any parent tasks.

In fact, I can have a working parent task, and the moment I attach a subtask to it the Start and Due Date as well as percent done all disappear from the edit screen.

Thank you.

Mark

We use redmine services for ticketing tool.
But we see that redmine is very slow specially showing the UI during peak hours means when multiple users logged in and multiple issues are logged.
Can you please advise on the same.
We use webrick as webserver,is that the reason behind this?
