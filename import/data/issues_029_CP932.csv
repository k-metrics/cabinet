I'm trying to create an issus in ruby script with one custom_field. I've created custom field (down drop list with 5 values) with web interface. I tried to do this according to wiki: [[Rest_api_with_ruby]], but I think this wiki page is out of date. I searched for older tickets, found that 'custom_field_values' isn't used anymore, the new approach is to do this with array 'custom_fields' and by update operation (get issue by id and set values in custom_fields array). 
The example given in wiki throws error: 
<pre>ActiveResource::BadRequest: Failed.  Response code = 400.  Response message = Bad Reques</pre>

The best solution would be to assign the right value while creating issue (one save operation), I don't want to create it in first step, and then set the right value of custom field with update method (two save operations).

Is it possible? Please, correct the wiki page if it's deprecated.

Thx for help.

The main reason I would like to see this included in the repository is to be able to simply update redmine via git/hg.

As an example, I am using ""redmine-like-a-boss"":https://github.com/cytopia/redmine-like-a-boss, which always includes redmine in the last stable version as a submodule. I want to be able to simply *git checkout LATEST_TAG* if a newer version is released and don't worry about that my *settings.yml* file will be overwritten by a pull.

I guess others will probably also want to use redmine update mechanisms via *git pull* or an equivalent for *hg*.

The only drawback of this pull request is that you might need to extend the redmine installation documentation with

<pre>
cp config/settings.yml.example config/settings.yml

But afterwards, the update management will be easier.
