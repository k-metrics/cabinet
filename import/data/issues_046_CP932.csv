Here is our setup:

We have a project called ""Unassigned"" where all incoming issues are stored. They're assigned to a group for processing. A member of that group then takes those unassigned tickets and will reassign to the appropriate technician.

When we ran 2.6.1 with these Email notification settings:

<pre>
[x] Issue added
[ ] Issue updated
    [x] Note added
    [ ] Status updated
    [ ] Assignee updated
    [ ] Priority updated
[x] News added
[x] Comment added to a news
[x] Document added
[x] File added
[x] Message added
[x] Wiki page added
[x] Wiki page updated
</pre>

everyone in the group was notified of the new issue, but nothing past that, regardless of whether a Note was added to the issue when it was moved. 

Now after the upgrade to 2.6.3 with the same Email notification settings the group is notified when the issue is reassigned. From what I can tell this only occurs if a comment is added."

We were having anonymous watchers issue in 1.3.2 so i had tried this Feature #5159 (http://www.redmine.org/issues/5159) update #5 , it did sort of worked for us. But can this be causing an issue now ? cause any projects created after that are not sending watchers an email.

that request is still relevant, but I decided to submit a smaller feature request about date formats.

Redmine 3.x broke backward compatibility - the date format used in REST responses is different from Redmine 2.6:

> From redmine 2.6.0: ""updated_on"":""2015-01-23T00:15:24Z""
> From redmine 3.0.0: ""updated_on"":""2015-01-29T10:06:19.000Z""

one of our users submitted this bug report: https://github.com/taskadapter/redmine-java-api/pull/175

if we could query Redmine to see its version, we could pick the right date format instead of guessing... now we will have to check ""are there 3 more digits after this and before that?""..

but a better option would be querying Redmine to see what date format it uses for long dates and short dates - because this is what the library actually cares about.

After 3.0.0 release we have switched to this new version to be sure we are using current Redmine branch, and our installation is not so outdated. We are using Bitnami 3.0.0 installer for windows platforms.

We have found a problem, that if a wiki page contains russian word ""Информация"" (tranlation: Information) written with capital letter only! If this word is present in wiki page name (no matter if it is first word in wiki page name or it will be one of the next words) it will lead to ""Internal server error"" while trying to access a page.

For example:
""Справочная информация"" - this wiki page name opens normal
""Справочная Информация"" - this wiki page name will lead to ""Internal server error"" error message

""информация по учетным записям трекеров контейнерных линий"" - this wiki page name opens normal
""Информация по учетным записям трекеров контейнерных линий"" - this wiki page name will lead to ""Internal server error"" error message

All other wiki pages, tasks, everyting works correct. We have run migration two times:
this way
rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production
and this way:
set RAILS_ENV=production
rake db:migrate

migration reports no errors.

Later we noticed, that actually a broken page exists, and we can open it by changing letter ""И"" from capital to ""и"" at the browser address line. We had so far only 5 problem pages, and we renamed them all to use small ""и"" letter at the wiki page name. This is of course a workaround, and problem exists.

To confirm error, we have installed clean Redmine 3.0.0 instance from bitname at another PC and tried to make a wiki page there using ""Информация"" word, mistake is the same. So I think its not a DB migration error, its most likely error in Redmine itself (or probably some conflict with software that bitnami intaller uses)

As you could see the '1.0' string incorrectly treated as 'Float' and could not be converted.

The cause of the defect is that Markdown formatter generates escaped file name. ApplicationController#parse_inline_attachments (source:trunk/app/helpers/application_helper.rb@14003#L637) expects a file name without escaping.

Textile:
<pre>
!caf?.jpg!   =>   <img src=""caf?.jpg"" alt="""" />

Markdown:

![](caf?.jpg)   =>   <img src=""caf%C3%A9.jpg"" alt="""">

bug cause:

this database record:

<pre>
INSERT INTO `settings` VALUES (68,'commit_update_keywords','--- \n- keywords: !binary |\n    Zml4ZXMsY2xvc2VzLNC40YHQv9GA0LDQstC70LXQvdC+LNCz0L7RgtC+0LLQ\n

</pre>

- this database record works fine in redmine 2.5.2 and cause 500 internal server error in redmine 2.6.2.

how to make workaround:

1. 
<pre>
delete from settings where name='commit_update_keywords';
</pre>

2. 
restart redmine (""systemctl restart passenger@redmine"" or something like this)

3. 
enter into /settings url and recreate this record manually from redmine interface,
and now - all works fine, no more 500 errors. 

after manual fix / workaround database record for commit_update_keywords now looks like this:

<pre>
INSERT INTO `settings` VALUES (75,'commit_update_keywords','---\n- status_id: \'5\'\n  done_ratio: \'100\'\n  keywords: fixes,closes,исправлено,готово,сделано,fixed\n','2015-03-08 15:16:28');
