14527,Redmine,Patch,"",New,Normal,Git-smart-http authentication by repository,Ciprian Ciubotariu,"",2013-07-24 00:16,SCM extra,"","","","",0,2013-07-23 17:05,"","","","","This patch allows the repository name to differ from the project name.

We migrated to a multi-repository per project setup after the whole infrastructure (scripts, build servers etc.) was set up. At this point we considered that renaming all the repositories to match the project identifier is too time-consuming and error-prone.

The compromise we found is to path the authentication script so that is also looks at the pool of repository identifiers when authenticating a git-smart-http request:

# extract the project/repository identifier from the request URI
# if it is a project identifier, use that project to authenticate the request
# if it is a repository identifier, use the first project it belongs to authenticate the request.

While this patch does not represent a full solution to the multi-repository problem, I hope it helps others in the same situation as us."
14526,Redmine,Defect,"",Closed,Normal,Default Theme: Apparent strange behaviour with the main-menu when many submenus are added,Shmuel Levine,"",2013-07-23 22:01,Themes,"","","","",0,2013-07-23 16:56,2013-07-23 22:01,次のチケットと重複 #6624,Duplicate,2.3.2,"When using the Default Theme (may be true of others as well, but not yet tested), I have an issue that when plugins add many items to the main-menu, the main menu becomes unwieldly long and exceeds the width of the rest of the page.  

1) I would expect for the menu items to wrap nicely once they reach the screen width and not force me to scroll to see all of the items.  

2) To make things worse, because the overall background is white, the menu items are unreadable unless hovering over them.

3) The issue appears to be related to the main application.css stylesheet located in public/stylesheets.  #main-menu has set margin-right to be -500px.  When this is removed, everything works as expected.

-- Is there a reason for this setting in the stylesheet?  It would seem to cause some major formatting issues.
---> I do not want to manually change this on my system as it would then affect any future updates...
---> I know that I can make a custom theme that just overrides this item, and I will in the interim, but this seems to me to be an issue that other would be having as well."

Problem: The style of a check item in the issue checklist gets unsychronized if multiple boxes are checked quickly on a slow/busy connection

Expected behaviour:
When on an issue page, after checking a checkbox in the checklist, another one is checked before the submission of the first check has made the server roundtrip. Both checkboxes are checked, and both checkitem texts are strikethourgh. VIce versa for unchecking the boxes.

Actual behaviour:
When on an issue page, after checking a checkbox in the checklist, another one is checked before the submission of the first check has made the server roundtrip. First checkboxes are checked, first item checkitem text is strikethough, the second checkbox is only checked but not strikethrough. When unchecking the box again, the text becomes strikethrough (the styleing is now in an inverse state). Clearly a client-side problem, reloading the page resolves the inconsistency.

However, there is a case that both identifier/name are different.
To make it work, attached file is the changes I made to Redmine.pm on Redmine2.3.1.

Simply, I added a RedmineProjectId field to define the redmine project id.
If this field is written in configuration file, use it for $project_id.

Without this bugfix, the revisions are not handled correctly. Each revision-number (e.g. 1.4) is only accepted once by the redmine repository, although each file has its own revision-numbers.

In our case the CVSROOT looks like this:
<pre>:pserver:cvs_user:cvs_password@123.456.789.123:9876/repo</pre>
The problem is located in _\lib\redmine\scm\adapters\cvs_adapter.rb_ in the method _root_url_path_
