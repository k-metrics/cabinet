http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22638972/debug-apache-2-4-perlauthenhandler

Detailed: When my project is not public everything works fine (authentication with subsequent git clone). But when my project is public (Authentication required is disabled) than i get the internal server error message 500. In my error log on the server the following message appears:

<pre>
""AH00027: No authentication done but request not allowed without authentication for $PATH. Authentication not configured?""
</pre>

Before upgrading it was possible for me to clone a public repository without authentication. Why it is currently disabled?

redmine 2.5.0 -> davmail 4.4.1-2225 -> exchange 2010

We process mail messages via rake like so:

rake -f /usr/local/redmine/Rakefile redmine:email:receive_imap RAILS_ENV=""production"" host=xxx port=xxx username=xxx password=xxx project=pickle unknown_user=accept allow_override=project no_permission_check=1

Example of a test e-mail msg:

Subject: test email bug 1

Test message 1 body

Project: project1
Tracker: Bug
Priority: Urgent

After the rake is run, issues are created, however none of the fields are populated. 

Looking at mail_handler.rb, we should have the complete email object @ line 74:

  def receive(email)
    @email = email

Dumping @email.inspect to logger, I see the following quite incomplete msg:

#<Mail::Message:70045583405560, Multipart: false, Headers: <Date: Tue, 20 May 2014 16:36:48 -0400>, <Message-ID: <537bbce0d8a9b_2d6b43fb4c02b7e8889470@xxx>>, <Mime-Version: 1.0>, <Content-Type: text/plain>, <Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit>>

Thinking that maybe this is connected to our local mail encoding, I tried sending plain text mail from gmail, but saw the same results.

My next thought was that something is off on the davmail -> exchange side, but retrieving the mail body via imap seems to work fine. (imap retrieval log attached).

Is it possible that there's a Redmine bug causing incomplete email msg retrieval?"

There seems to be a check missing on the start date and end dates of a subitem if a parent with a ""follows"" relation is added to the subitem. 

h4. Here are a few key features of Redmine to keep in mind in relation to this Defect:

* Parent items inherit the min Start Date from subitems, as well as max End Dates from subitems
* How Precedes and Follows relations work as shown here: [[RedmineIssues]]

h4. Below you will find the steps to reproduce in which I have tried to describe to the best of my ability. 

Steps to Reproduce:

# Create 3 Issues in a project (Issue 1, Issue 2, Issue 3)
# Make Issue 1 Parent item of Issue 2
# Add a relation: Issue 3 *precedes* Issue 1
# Test the following: set issue 2 at an earlier start date than issue 3's start date -- this should throw an error as expected when you press ""submit"".
# Now, change Issue 2's Start Date back to the original accepted Start Date.
# Clear the Parent Field from Issue 2 and press submit
# Set Issue 2 to an earlier start date than Issue 3 and press submit
# Again Make Issue 1 Parent item of Issue 2 and press submit. -- notice how the invalid start date is accepted here
# You will notice that Issue 1 has had its start date changed to the invalid one as well as it inherits the min start date from its subitem Issue 2.

Feel free to let me know if you would like me to elaborate on anything/have any questions."

I've latest redmine 2.5.1 installed with several plugins.
I tried plugin update check, but the result wasn't as expected.

!plugin-updatecheck-incomplete.png!

For some plugins the check can't find updates as these aren't in the official repository.
For some plugins the check reports a good result and marks the version entry with a green tick icon.

And for some plugin the script links the version number to the correct redmine plugin reposity site but doesn't add the green tick mark.

See ""Project Alias"" plugin in the screenshot. The version number is linked to http://www.redmine.org/plugins/project_alias where the version information says, that my installed version 0.1.0 is the latest.
However, the green tick mark isn't added by the javascript.

There's no error in the firebug console, but I can see that the script only adds the class ""found"" to the version span: @<span class=""icon found"">@.

But I'd expect @<span class=""icon found icon-checked"">@"

It's works very well with receive_imap parameter and unknown_users=1.

The problem is the project maanger does not receive a notification of new issue created by our clients.
If I create an issue from the redmine interface, the notification worked.

My SMTP settings are async_smtp with gmail account.

Thanks for your help !

*What happens?*

I have made an update from version 2.2 to 2.5.1. Now I have the problem that some of the issues are causing an internal error. All these issues have a history but not all issues with a history are causing that error. According to the stack trace in the production log the method format_value is affected. Here two stack traces:

I have not figured out yet what kind of journal entry in the history is the reason, but I try to get more details ASAP. Anyway, maybe one of the developers might have an idea what is going wrong here.
