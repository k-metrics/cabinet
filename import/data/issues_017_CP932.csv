25146,Redmine,Defect,"",Closed,Normal,Issue while modifying subproject configuration without the permission to create a subproject,Philippe Lotterie,"",2017-02-22 05:46,Project settings,"","","","",0,2017-02-21 19:47,2017-02-22 05:46,次のチケットと重複 #20282,Duplicate,3.0.4,"Hi,

When submitting changes for a subproject while the user doesn't have the permission to create a subproject, he gets an error telling that the value of the subproject field is not correct.
The permissions he has for the projects are Modify project and Manage members.
Of course granting Create subproject permission shows the subproject field in the configuration page and fixes this issue.

Thank you for this great software,

Worst Case Scenario
User login credentials could be stolen in specific scenarios. There is high change of retrieving valid accounts
when computers are shared between several users by double clicking the username field (""username"") in the
login pages. Once the attacker has a valid set of users, those can be used in brute force attacks."

Can I change the ""Unknown user"" error message to something else in case of lost_password promt.

Dulicating my query:
1. Go to the application login page and click on the Lost Password link.
2. Type an in invalid email and click on the Submit button.
3. Finally you will get a message saying Unknown user. With message this you can setup a script to
distinguish valid accounts from the invalid ones.
Recommendation
An application should respond with a generic error message regardless of whether the user ID or password was
incorrect. It should also give no indication to the status of an existing account.
Send an authentication token to the users email in order to prompt the security questions.

We don't use plural form after numbers greater than one, but we use other forms for different expressions.

E.g. _hour_ is _?ra_ in Magyar;
[point in time] _x hour(s) ago_ is _x ?r?ja_ or _x ?r?val ezel?tt_;
[present perfect continuous] _for x hour(s)_ is _x ?r?ja_;
[past, future or undetermined tense] _for x hour(s)_ is _x ?r?ig_ or _x ?r?n_ ?t.

Label_added_time_by needs point in time (and optional non-relative times, but that's a different issue, although a possible workaround);
while e.g. setting_session_lifetime needs _?ra_ without agglutination.

Filters:
label_between: _between x [and] y_ should be _x ?s y k?z?tt_;
day related filters are somewhat clumsy in English, too (e.g. _less than days ago ... days_), but I could improve it in Magyar: ""label_less_than_ago: nem r?gebbi, mint"" meaning _not older than_, but it must be followed by _x nap_ (base word of day), not _x napja_ (point in time);
label_in_the_past_days: needs to be followed by _napban_ (base word of day + _in_ postfix), etc."

When looking into this I found that the easiest fix for this would be to change the two conditionals in attachment.rb that prevent an empty file from being treated like any non-empty file.

1. Create a new issue
2. Update the issue to another status, which has required field in my workflow configuration. The required field is List format configured in Custom fields.
3. Choose a value in the list, save the issue successfully.
4. The filed value leaves empty after a success save.

Plus, I have some new findings. Let's call the custom field as Field-A, Field-A has three values a,b,c.

1. Set Field-A to a, save the issue.
2. The Field-A leaves empty.
3. Update the issue, set Field-A to b, save the issue.
4. The Field-A's value is successfully set to b
5. Update the issue, set Field-A to a (which is initially value in step 1), save the issue.
5. The Field-A's value is still b, but a is expected here.

If the initial value is b, the repeat steps 2-5, you will find the initial value can't be saved. But if you change the value of this field the save the issue, it works well."

I don't know what the fix actually is, but this Stackoverflow.com[1] thread mentioned this:

> The combination of using: <code>@file = IO.read(file).force_encoding(""ISO-8859-1"").encode(""utf-8"", replace: nil)</code> and <code>#encoding: UTF-8</code> solved the issue.

I don't have Ruby knowledge, but I'll start digging through the code on my end to see if I can find where to make those changes. Please let me know if you need additional information.

in the first column (""Version""), you can click on the version (e.g. 3.1.0.p9, link https://myseerver/versions/186) and get the list of issues targeting this version).

When I open the version settings (""Edit"" in the last column) and fill in the ""Wiki page"", the link https://myseerver/versions/186 becomes invalid (see ""invalid page"" screenshot).

When I empty ""Wiki page"" for the version, the link becomes valid again.

I'm not sure where the link https://myseerver/versions/186 should point when the version wiki page is filled, I'd expect it still should show the list of the issues.

24924,Redmine,Defect,"",Closed,Normal,Redmine installation produces different results depending on the date installed,Angelo Bertolli,"",2017-01-27 06:45,Gems support,"","","","",0,2017-01-25 21:59,2017-01-26 03:02,"",Wont fix,3.3.1,"h2. The general problem

Redmine releases leave their dependencies open-ended, and assume that later versions of gems will always be backward compatible and can be installed with the release.

If you install Redmine on a system using the instructions on the site, you will get a different result depending on what version of a gem happens to be available at that time.

h2. A side effect, specific example of this being an issue

When the Gemfile specifies a version like '>= x.x.x' it will throw an error during installation if the newest version of a gem has changed dependencies.

e.g.

* When Redmine 3.3.1 was released it could be installed on RHEL 7 using Ruby 2.0
* At some point in time, nokogiri 1.7 was released that requires Ruby 2.1
* When attempting to run bundler to install Redmine on an identical system after this point will generate an error requiring Ruby 2.1

h2. Solution

The current/correct practice for maintaining a Gemfile should be to use '~> x.x.x' whenever possible.  This ensures both that (1) the version of the gem that was verified with a particular release is used, and (2) future gem versions do not cause unresolved dependency problems.
