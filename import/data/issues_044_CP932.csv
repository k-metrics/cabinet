This is confusing some users. I believe the page should be refreshed automatically to show the @welcome#index@.

Is this fixable? For now I just extended the @attachment#show@ to also work for binary files (show the download link), but it doesn't look very good and it doesn't fix the @attachment#download@ links in @back_url@, only the @attachment#show@ ones.

But when I get e-mail notifications, I cannot follow the links in them, because they look like this: @myserver/issues/43@ but they should look like this: @myserver:12321/issues/43@ - so everithing after colon and colon itself disappeared, like it was escaped or something.

Why is this? What should I do to make links in e-mail notifications be correct?

I'm using Redmine 3.0.1 that has Wiki pages as the follow:

!wiki.gif!

After upgrading from 2.6.x to 3.0.1, it occurs ""Internal server error"" when I click ""red arrow"" pages of image.
The title of those pages include ""Korea character"" in common.

There are no problem when clicking Wiki pages of only ""English character"".

I think all 2-byte characters also have the same issue.

Thanks,

Then I logout my developer account and login by another account  (role 'reporter'). In reporter-account I can see the issue list. I try to assign new task to my developer account but it still doesn't work.

I have changed something such as: I copied 'reporter' role and set its to my developer-account, or changed my developer-account to others role, but not anything changes except 'reporter' role, it's still not show the issue list.Finally I have changed my config to show sql query, I execute this query and it return many data rows.

19599,Redmine,Defect,"",New,Normal,Redmine does not honnor RFC822 4.4.3 reply-to field in incoming emails,Mark Solly,"",2015-05-10 06:08,Email receiving,"","","","",0,2015-04-13 04:35,"","","","","Many modern (or just well-configured) SMTP servers will block a user from impersonating another email address by re-writing the 'from' header into the 'reply-to' header and setting 'from' as the actual sending account name. This caused a problem for me when creating tickets from the email issued by a website contact form. The notifications would go to the wrong address and the user account would not be created.

I'm not clear on weather the responsibility for this should lie with Redmine or Mail::Message but I've patched my Redmine installation with the following code at the start of the receive(email) method in app/models/mail_handler.rb.

If I knew more about Redmine I'd try to make a plugin that solved the issue, perhaps someone else can.

I've verified this problem exists in trunk and 2.6.3.stable.

This is my fix:
<pre><code class=""ruby"">
  # Processes incoming emails
  # Returns the created object (eg. an issue, a message) or false
  def receive(email)
    @email = email
    sender_email = email.from.to_a.first.to_s.strip

    #RFC822 Sections 4.4.3 and 4.4.4 say that if the reply-to field exists, mail should not be sent to the address in the 'from' field.
    #Correct handling of 'reply-to' is required for SMTP servers that do not allow senders to fake the 'from' field.
    #Website contact forms transmitted through a gmail SMTP server are a good example.
    if email['reply-to'].present?
        replyto_email = email['reply_to'].to_s.strip
        logger.info ""Email contains a reply-to field. Will attempt to use '"" + replyto_email + ""' instead of '"" + sender_email + ""'""
        sender_email = replyto_email
    end
