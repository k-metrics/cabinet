1. 'Aleksandr Guidrevitch' has the same email in commits and redmine settings. His email contains a dot, eg some.user@somehost.com, just in case
2. Admin -> Settings -> Repositories -> 'Enable time logging' is on
3. Admin -> Settings -> Repositories -> 'Activity for logged time' is 'Development' and 'Development' is enabled activity in the project commits are done for
4. Git repository is refreshed using github_hook plugin, but it is not failure of this plugin as far as I can tell from the code.

For my projects, I would like:
* to send ""News"" to all users if they take part in a project
* that users receive notifications about Issues updates _if and only if_ they are assigned to that Issue.
I do not want all users to receive notifications when any Issue is updated.

Is that possible in v2.2.3 ?

It worked in a previous version (I can't rememeber which but it is more than 2 years old).
For the moment, with the following settings, users receive News notifications but not Issues creations/updates even if they are assigned to an issue.
* the users have the following notification settings: ""For any event on all my projects"",
* in the projects, notifications are activated only for the ""News"" but not for the ""Issues"".
If I activate ""Issues"", _all_ users receive a notification when I modify or create an Issue.

I have seen the following Defect that could explain the evolution.

Unfortunately, this RegEx doesn't match newlines, which can occur in filenames of attachments. This causes actions with views showing attachments with full paths, for example using source:/branches/2.3-stable/app/helpers/application_helper.rb#L88, to crash.

Saddly, it is not possible to use a multiline RegEx (@/.*/m@) to also match newlines in routes constraints, the best way we (Planio) have found to work around this is to use a negative match group with just @/@: @/[^\/]*/@. @/@ are not allowed in filenames, and the routes constraint thus allows everything but a @/@.

this patch corrects a bug in the calculation of the done_ratio value in some edge case.

Ways to reproduce this bug:
* Define a parent issue
* Define two subissues on this parent issue
* Set on one subissue estimated_hours to 0
* Close subissue with no estimated_hours -> parent issue has done_ratio = 50%
* Close subissue with estimated_hours set to zero value -> parent issue still has done_ratio = 50%

This patch solves this issue.

# yard is parsing test files of core plugins, while it shouldn't
# yard is not parsing regular files of third-party plugins, while it should

The first issue is being caused by source:/trunk/lib/tasks/yardoc.rake#L5 which adds _lib/**/*.rb_ to @files@. After r9533 Rails plugins required by the core are located in _lib/plugins_ instead of _vendor/plugins_, so they are now going to be parsed by yard already through source:/trunk/lib/tasks/yardoc.rake#L5, instead of being added through source:/trunk/lib/tasks/yardoc.rake#L6 which does have the exclusion regex for test files.

The second issue is being caused by source:/trunk/lib/tasks/yardoc.rake#L6 which is still expecting plugins to reside in _vendor/plugins_ instead of _plugins_ (pre r9503).

The following patch should fix both of the above mentioned issues:

Note: this patch will also make yard to exclude test files under other directories in _lib_ besides _lib/plugins_, but:
* quick-scan: there are none...

This css file resides in the $REDMINE install folder, and unlike application.css, it is not merged with the  corresponding stylesheet in the theme.

Of course I went ahead and just duplicated the offending style definition in $THEME/stylesheets/application.css and marked it as !important, but it feels kludgy.

Could the same approach used currently with application.css be used with scm.css? or maybe It's done and I missed something?

When I switch projects, redmine forgets my issue filters for the last project. It would be great if it remembered the filter for each project. Maybe by creating a different cookie for each project?

Reproduce:
1. Apply a filter to the issues in a project.
2. Open a new tab in the browser and apply a filter in a different project.
3. Click the issues redmine tab in the first project.

Expected:
The filter is still there.

Actual:
The filter returns to the default, and must be selected again.

Notes:
Creating custom queries is a possible workaround, but still requires an extra page load because redmine loads the default filter, then, after you click the link to the custom query, loads again.
