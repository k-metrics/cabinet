This might however not be the day in the user's timezone if they use a different one as the server. These queries can then show unexpected issues that do not match the filter according to the user's timezone.

Furthermore, even if the date is correct, the exact cut-off time still needs to be done in the user's timezone. Suppose the server is set to GMT and the user has configured Europe/Berlin (GMT+2:00 right now) as their time zone. When querying for all issues updated yesterday, the result should include all issues updated between 2015-08-03 02:00:00 GMT and 2015-08-04 01:59:59 GMT. Right now, it would however only include issues updated between 2015-08-03 00:00:00 GMT and 2015-08-03 23:59:59 GMT.

The attached patch against the current trunk fixes both of these issues by applying the following changes to the query model:

* It calculates the cut-of time based on the current user timezone instead of assuming midnight at server-local time
* it uses @User.current.today@ instead of @Date.today@ to get the correct reference day in the user's timezone

The patch was extracted from ""Planio"":https://plan.io/redmine-hosting/."
20472,Redmine,Defect,"",New,Normal,Filtered API calls delete CORS,Tommaso Visconti,"",2015-08-04 17:51,REST API,"","","","",0,2015-08-04 17:51,"","","",2.6.0,"This is a strange behaviour of the API. I'm using rack-cors to enable API consuming by other apps (Ember.js).

When using various endpoints (/issues.json, time_entries.json, projects.json) everything is ok.

With this specific call, CORS headers aren't added to the response and the browser blocks the request with the ""famous"" error: @No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource@
The call is:

<pre>
/time_entries.json?user_id=<ID>
or
/time_entries.json?user_id=me
</pre>

The only added header is:

<pre>
X-Rack-CORS: preflight-hit; no-origin
</pre>

If I change the param with something not recognized by redmine (e.g. ?wrong_param=me), everything works well (the response isn't filtered). So the problem seems to be related to the filtering of the time entries by user.
Maybe with this particular filtering redmine creates a different response which avoid the rack-cors action?

The correct headers, added by rack-cors, should be:

<pre>
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:4200
Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, DELETE, PUT, OPTIONS, HEAD
Access-Control-Max-Age: 0
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true

After I read that I started another round of commit hunting. I have summed up the issues I found ? and how I found them, using some ASCII-""art"". See below.
I'll start with a to-do section which list the commits that needs to be merged in 3.1-stable, the commits that can/should be merged in 3.1-stable and the commits that shouldn't be merged into 3.1-stable since they are related to issues that are explicitly targeted to 3.2.0 at the time of writing this.
Then I start a section which compares the commits on trunk versus the commits (backports/merges) on 3.1-stable which in the end provides a list of commits applied on trunk but not on 3.1-stable, which I in turn used to specify which commits belong to what and what should be done them. That itself is what I used to fill in the to-do section.
Note that I also include a third 'legend' section to make sure that my ""art"" can be understood ;-)...

I'll leave the scheduling decision (strict: 3.2.0, lenient: 3.1.1) to the committers.

Please note that this issue brings me to issue #18134 again, and in particular to the questions I raised in its note #18134-5 (before ""The examples:""). If SCM-provided merge tracking features are used and maintained correctly, issues like this one and previous #18174 could have been spotted right on with some higher certainty. Just my two cents...

Kind regards, Mischa.

The error occures in context with the redmine_contacts and the redmine_ckeditor, but the failing code is lib/redmine/wiki_formatting.rb of the core-code.
To reproduce the error create a contact and add a note with the following content:

Further investigations shows, that for some html-code-snippets (like the one above - I actually was not able to determine the exact combination of tags/words/formatting-stuff that leads to the error) the following code of lib/redmine/wiki_formatting.rb breaks:

<pre>
115       def auto_link!(text)
116         text.gsub!(AUTO_LINK_RE) do
117           all, leading, proto, url, post = $&, $1, $2, $3, $6
118           if leading =~ /<a\s/i || leading =~ /![<>=]?/
119             # don't replace URLs that are already linked
120             # and URLs prefixed with ! !> !< != (textile images)
121             all
122           else
123             # Idea below : an URL with unbalanced parenthesis and
124             # ending by ')' is put into external parenthesis
125             if ( url[-1]==?) and ((url.count(""("") - url.count("")"")) < 0 ) )
126               url=url[0..-2] # discard closing parenthesis from url
127               post = "")""+post # add closing parenthesis to post
128             end
129             content = proto + url
130             href = ""#{proto==""www.""?""http://www."":proto}#{url}""
131             %(#{leading}<a class=""external"" href=""#{ERB::Util.html_escape href}"">#{ERB::Util.html_escape content}</a>#{post}).html_safe
132           end
133         end
134       end
</pre>

The reason is, that the variables of line 117 (all, leading, proto, url, post) are empty, which leads to an exception in line 125.
I am not a ruby-programmer - but I wonder how it could be that $& is not set when the regular expression obviously matched? Otherwise we would not enter the loop at all, do we?"

In addition, I can create new tickets as copy from old ticket, but I can't select other statuses.

I investigated MySQL table ""issue_statuses"", I found there is not ""is_default"" field that old redmine has.

In the ""Spent time"" panel on ""My page"", the ""Activity"" and ""Project"" columns don't wrap text, leading to unattractive formatting (see attached ""screenShot1.jpg"").  A little patch to ""application.css"" alters it so that those columns do wrap (see attached ""screenShot2.jpg"", and ""application.css.diff"".

It may be design intent that they don't wrap, in which case of course reject this, but my users here like it better wrapping (as it did in early versions of Redmine), so I said I'd request the change.

We are user of Redmine on hostedredmine.com/ and we have problems with the structure of the projects.

We have defined four subprojects under one general project. This worked well and we could see all issues of all subproject on the general project page.  Since last week the structure is changed and all projects are now subprojects of another, for me not familiar, project ""Empresa de Consultoria""?

Does anyone know how to solve this?

Thanks in advance.

20384,Redmine,Patch,"",New,Normal,Proposal: Workflow enhancement,Frederico Camara,"",2017-03-14 15:18,Issues workflow,"","","","",0,2015-07-21 15:20,"","","","","I work at a large ICT public company in Brazil and we are using Redmine here.

At first it didn't become apparent that the workflow tools in Redmine would be limiting in any way. But as we start to build more complex workflows and reutilize roles and tracker names for different projects and teams, we noticed that a workflow being inherent to a specific role and tracker, was making us come with similar names and synonyms to roles and trackers so we could develop new workflows for a different areas in our company. Examples of this are: using lower and uppercase in names, adding numbers, using words in both genders (substantives in portuguese have gender inflexion). Ultimately it became an annoyance, as similar entries would populate various menus across Redmine.

Also, the closed state being inherent to a issue status, also made we duplicate entries, bacause in a workflow, some state would close the issue whereas in another workflow, the same state would not.

I still think workflows should still be inherent to roles and trackers, but projects could have diferent workflow sets to choose from, so that you could still have different projects using the same workflow and at the same time could have different projects using different workflows.

Also, the closed state should be inherent to the workflow being used.

For a first proposal, I would have another entry in the admin menu for a workspace, workflow set, or workflow space, or whatever the best term is in english. From there, workflows would be part of a workspace and in each project you would select the workspace to use. For migration purposes, all existing and new workflows and projects would be assigned to the default workspace. New subprojects should have selected the same workspace as the parent at creation. There is no inheritance of workspace between projects.

The main advantages are:

* fewer roles created;
* fewer issue statuses created;
* simpler migration between workflows;
* more control over complex infrastructure;
* very low impact on simpler infrastructure."
