When I switch projects, redmine forgets my issue filters for the last project. It would be great if it remembered the filter for each project. Maybe by creating a different cookie for each project?

Reproduce:
1. Apply a filter to the issues in a project.
2. Open a new tab in the browser and apply a filter in a different project.
3. Click the issues redmine tab in the first project.

Expected:
The filter is still there.

Actual:
The filter returns to the default, and must be selected again.

Notes:
Creating custom queries is a possible workaround, but still requires an extra page load because redmine loads the default filter, then, after you click the link to the custom query, loads again.

h5. I'm 5 years old

h3. Hi

Expected:

Notes:
Probably because the h5 is not dynamically assigned a pencil button like the other headers are.

Viewing the roadmap of the parent project it says milestone ""version 2.3"" has 2 tickets ? but it only shows 1 ticket in the list (a ticket in tracker ""defect"").
The second ticket is a subproject ticket set to a tracker which is only available in the subproject. Such tickets seem not to be shown in the parent project roadmap view.

BUT, and that's the strange thing, these subproject tickets +are+ shown on the version page (e.g. @http://{redmine-uri}/versions/{ID}@ ) where the version belongs to the parent project.
There seems to be an inconsistency between the roadmap and the version view.

I would suggest to show +all+ tickets in roadmap view - even if the specific tracker is only enabled in a subproject."

I've recently upgraded my redmine from 1.3.x to 2.3.2.
We're using a bitnami VM as I know very little about rails or supporting technology.

Initially, we were using mysql as the database (which ships with the bitnami install) and we noticed that the app would sometimes ""hang"" for periods of time when loading pages. 
I migrated it from mysql to sqlserver (as we have one in the office that serves our other dev systems) by copying the schema and data then updating database.yml and page load time dropped overall.
It's worth noting that we are also using SVN repository integration pointing at an external beanstalkapp SVN (cloud)

What I'm seeing is that sometimes the redmine instance just won't load a page for ages. It will just sit there and sometimes may show the ""an error has occurred""
I've grabbed a copy of the last 1000 lines of production.log and attached it to this issue. 
Most of the time everything will be fast and snappy but then occassionally, we'll get this (from production.log)

Redmine is built as a war using warbler-1.3.8, JRuby 1.7.2 and run on TOMCAT 7.0.37 with a JVM 1.6.31 on a RHEL 64 bit machine.
The database is a Mysql 5.5.28 and redmine tables are using a charset utf8.
We connect Redmine database with the following database.yml:

<pre>
production:

   jndi: java:/comp/env/jdbc/Redmine
   driver: com.mysql.jdbc.Driver

As a workaround we can create the issue with the subject and update it with the detail in a second step...
