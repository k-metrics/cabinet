A small change should be made, to stop using the .js  extension in these specific places.

Because:
Many Redmine users, configure Apache/Nginx to cache-in-the-browser  all static files, such as .css and .js.
And the obvious config:  is to look for files name *.js or *.css.

But those users will experience problems, that they then post here about (see list at the end).
It is a hard thing to diagnose  -because the connection between the apache.nginx change and these specific, local problems:   is not obvious.

*It happens alot, so fixing this will save many people pain.*

When people add a Nginx or Apache config to cache all .js files - at first everything seems to work... but then a day or more later they will notice a problem:   it will happen on one of a few specific places

*a) Click 'edit' on an existing journal in an issue*

17748,Redmine,Patch,"",New,Normal,Subrepositories Fail to Authenticate Internal Users upon Subversion Checkout,David Pettifor,"",2014-09-24 11:18,SCM extra,"","","","",0,2014-08-26 21:08,"","","","","* DBMS: PostgreSQL 8.4.20
* Ruby 1.9.3p547
* Rails 3.2.13
* Redmine 2.2.4.stable.11981

We have setup Apache 2.2.5 to host subversion repositories created in our local directory ""/var/svn/"".  We can browse these repositories through Redmine just fine.  However, when an internal Redmine user tries to checkout a secondary repository using a local ""svn checkout"" command, they would fail to authenticate against any of these secondary repositories of a given project of which they are a member.


We tracked down the issue and found it to be located in the ""Redmine.pm"" file, located at

    /extra/svn/Redmine.pm

If we look at Line 246 (http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/repository/entry/trunk/extra/svn/Redmine.pm#L246), we are only gathering repository permission for a project whose identifier matches the repository identifier.  This is bad in at least two cases:

# If the repository is named something different than the project identifier (such as project identifier is ""myproject"" but the repository is at ""/var/svn/myproj"")
# If we have secondary repositories which of course would have a different identifier than the project's identifier

To fix this, we need to modifiy line 246 to include any _repository_ identifer *or* where the repository's _URL_ matches:

     AND (projects.identifier=?
     OR projects.id IN (SELECT project_id FROM repositories WHERE identifier = ?)
     OR projects.id IN (SELECT project_id FROM repositories WHERE url LIKE '%/'||?)
     )

Of course, we'll also need to pass in the project identifier another two times when the Perl string is compiled upon execution, which happens on line 461 (or 464 with the added code above):

    $sth->execute($redmine_user, $project_id, $project_id, $project_id);

I hope this is a good solution for anyone having the same issues out there, and hope that this (or an adaptation of this) is included in some future release!

When you are in the *issues view of a project*, you can set a filter and - permission provided - switch between different views (Gantt, Calendar, Issues) without losing the filter settings by using the respective links in the projects menu:

!project_issues_links.png!

But if you are in the *""global"" issues view* (via the ""View all issues"" link on the projects overview page) you don't have the projects menu available as you are in no project.

In the ""global"" issues view, you only can only switch between the views using the links in the sidebar. There you have ""filter-keeping"" links to the Gantt view and to the Calendar view (again, permission provided). *But what you do not have there is a link which brings you from the Gantt view or the Calendar view back to the issues view without losing the filter settings!* Therefore I created this patch, to also have a ""filter-keeping"" link to the issues view in the sidebar:

This e.g. includes non-breaking spaces which are common after e.g. signature delimiters (hyphen hyphen no-break-space).

This results in delimiters being not taken into account if there are these unicode whitespace characters at the end of the line.

The attached patch fixes this for Ruby versions >= 1.9. I have found no generally reliable way to fix this for Ruby 1.8 which thus retains the previous behavior. The reason this only works on Ruby >= 1.9 is that only this version includes a possibility to match unicode whitespace. Ruby 1.8 only has a limited list of ASCII characters (""against the unicode spec apparently"":http://stackoverflow.com/a/4981864).

Given that I can't change the behavior on 1.8, this change is unfortunately rather difficult to test. I have also attached a patch with improved tests which work properly on 1.9 and 2.0 but breaks on 1.8 as it doesn't recognize the change in behavior. Given that, I'd rather prefer to pull the improvement of behavior without the test than to hold everything out..."

# *invalidate the password reset token* (sent via email) once an account's *email address is changed*.
(This prevents hackers who may be able to change a user's address (or trick him into doing it) to use an ""old"" password reset link previously sent via email once the email address has been changed back by the user.)
# *invalidate the password reset token* and *autologin token* once an account's *password is changed*.
(This prevents hackers from being still able to login after a user has potentially discovered a breach into his/her account and changed their password.)

The attached patch against current Redmine trunk implements this; tests included.

After more investigation, I noticed that the date picket inserts the date in the following format:
08/18/2014

It should however be saved as:
2014-08-18

My guess is that this is in the datepicker itself, and that it tries to autodetect depending on your locale etc, so it might not be showing up to all users.

The current workaround is to manually enter the date format in the required format.

After a fresh installation, I tried to send myself a test email from the Settings. I was using sendmail as the email configuration. 

However, I kept getting DSN: Service unavailable (from my /var/mail/mail.log) and no email was sent to my inbox. By the way, I can send just find using 'sendmail' or 'mail' command directly from the terminal.

After some help and doing some testing, I realized my email object doesn't have `To` information:

<pre>
#<Mail::Message:69932463820220, Multipart: true, Headers: <From: amree@email.com>, <To: >, <Cc: >, <Bcc: [""amree@email.com""]>, <Subject: Redmine test>, <Mime-Version: 1.0>, <Content-Type: multipart/alternative; boundary=""--==_mimepart_53e9cc4e961bc_4e413f9a697f53bc626bb""; charset=UTF-8>, <X-Mailer: Redmine>, <X-Redmine-Host: localhost:3000>, <X-Redmine-Site: Redmine>, <X-Auto-Response-Suppress: OOF>, <Auto-Submitted: auto-generated>, <List-Id: <amree.usm.my>>>
</pre>

So, after turning Blind carbon copy recipients (bcc) setting off, I can now receive the test email. This means, I can't trun on BCC since my email won't be sent with that setting on. I'm not sure if this is a bug or not. But I don't think it is supposed to work like that.
