1) If the ""add file"" button is not clicked, the file should be deleted from the server.

2) It starts uploading a file after selecting the file, and not after deciding to create the ticket (in earlier version, the file was uploaded after final confirmation on ticket).

Doesn't seem to be configurable, and you cannot cancel a file once it's been uploaded (so it will use server space, even if you don't click the ""add"" button."

Although I'm not sure why this limit exists (I'll be adding another issue to make this a setting or remove it) redmine should definitely alert the end user to the limit both beforehand such as like the the text for max file size is displayed as well as after an attempt to add more than 10 files is added (javascript alert box or something similar).

I seem to have stumbled upon a bug in redmine: it seems impossible to move a _single_ issue to another project.

+What I do:+
- click 'edit' on an issue
- select different project in the drop-down menu

+What happens:+
- some popup shows for less than a second (so I donÅft know what it says)
- the drop-down menu jumps back to the current project

+What I expect:+
- the drop-down menu to stay on the selected project
- move the issue to the selected project on clicking ""submit""


It is, however, possible to move _multiple_ issues to another project by ""bulk-editing"" them as described below:
- have a list of issues, e.g. 'View all issues' in the project list
- select >1 issue (or you will get to the same page you get to when clicking ""edit"" in an issue)
- rightclick, edit
- select new project
- click ""submit""


I found several other people asking about similar issues in the last few years, but either no solution was provided for them, or the bug was fixed years ago, or the issue was related to a user having multiple, conflicting roles, one allowing him to move issues, the other not. I made sure to avoid such conflicts. References to similar issues I found but which did not seem to have a solution:
message#17810
message#34012
message#27807
message#16789
message#37718 (mentioned role-conflict issue)

IÅfm running redmine on debian testing (jessie) using apache and passenger, exact versions:

ruby-passenger                    4.0.53-1
</pre>

The server was initially set up with debian testing and the mentioned redmine-version just a few weeks ago. No migrations or updates have been made yet. No plugins are installed.

I tried running ""script/about"", but that only returned this info:
<pre>
ticket001:/usr/share/redmine# ruby script/about
script/about no longer exists, please use bin/about instead.
</pre>
There is no bin/about in the debian-package though.

+Question:+
Is this a bug or am I doing anything wrong?

_I appreciate any hint at what could be wrong and any pointer to relevant docs. Please tell me if this issue is missing information that might help find a solution. IÅfm also happy about pointers regarding how to debug an issue like that properly, as I have no idea how to go on._

The Redmine 2.5 instance works well.

I've done the following steps from RedmineUpgrade :

1. Download the release in either tar.gz or zip format and uncompress the new program archive in a new directory.

2. Copy your database settings-file config/database.yml into the new config directory. If you're running Redmine >= 1.4 with mysql and ruby1.9, change the database adapter to `mysql2`.

3a. Copy your base configuration settings-file config/configuration.yml into the new config directory.

4. Copy the files directory content into your new installation (this directory contains all your uploaded files).

5. Copy the folders of your custom plugins from your plugins directory (or vendor/plugins directory if upgrading from a 1.x version) into new installation plugins directory. Make sure that you copy only plugins that are were not initially bundled with your previous Redmine setup.

6. Install the required gems by running:

bundle install --without development test

7. Run the following command from your new Redmine root directory:

bundle exec rake generate_secret_token

I encountered this bug while customers complained about not receiving emails. Using debug log i could get the following informations:

That is the super method of the mailer class (ActionMailer::deliver_mail) called at this line. 
In order to get more detailed informations i printed out the mail object given to the method and got this in the log - while updating the issue the customer complained about not receiving an email:

(i marked internal informations with *** )

From what i see the mail object looks good.

I tried to look into the actionmailer but my ruby knowledge isn't good enough to go further.

I tried different mail send options:
/config/configuration.yml

<pre>
default:
  # Outgoing emails configuration (see examples above)
  email_delivery:
    delivery_method: :smtp
    smtp_settings:
      address: 127.0.0.1
      port: 25
      domain: ascendro.de
      authentication: :login
      user_name: ""m***t@a***e""
      password: ""***""
      openssl_verify_mode: 'none'
</pre>

and 

<pre>
default:
  # Outgoing emails configuration (see examples above)
  email_delivery:
    delivery_method: :sendmail
</pre>

without any change.

As already said, i was able to receive the test mail but it is possible that this error appears while sending the first mail and other people will not receive an email anymore."
