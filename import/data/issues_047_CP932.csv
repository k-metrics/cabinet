19297,Redmine,Defect,"",Closed,Normal,Custom fields with hidden/read-only combination displayed in Issue Edit Form,@ go2null,Jean-Philippe Lang,2015-03-20 10:52,Issues,2.6.4,"","","",0,2015-03-06 21:32,2015-03-20 10:52,"",Fixed,2.6.0,"*Observed Behavior*
* _UserA_ has two roles, _RoleA_ and _RoleB_.
* _CustomFieldA_ is hidden from _RoleB_. (In Custom Field Edit form, _RoleB_ is unchecked for *Visible*.)
* However, _CustomFieldA_ is visible to _RoleA_.
* In the *Workflow*, _CustomFieldA_ is set as @Read-Only@ for _RoleA_.
* _UserA_ can edit _TrackerA_.
* In the Issue Edit form, _CustomFieldA_ is displayed. However, any input is ignored (as the @Read-Only@ rule prevents it from being processed.)

*Desired/Expected Behavior*
* In the Issue Edit form, _CustomFieldA_ should not be displayed.

*Workaround*
* Allow _RoleB_ to view _CustomFieldA_.
* In the *Workflow*, set _CustomFieldA_ as @Read-Only@ for _RoleB_.
* The UI code correctly does not display @Read-Only@ fields.

This was tested on 2.3 and 2.5, but the code seems to still be in use in current trunk.

This is due to http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/repository/entry/branches/2.6-stable/app/models/repository.rb#L41 preventing successful saving in http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/repository/entry/branches/2.6-stable/app/models/repository/git.rb#L254 and makes the @before_destroy@ in @repository.rb@ fail.

I'm not quite sure what the intent of the validation was, I guess to enforce that if there is a repository with no identifier it is the default, but it seems possible to work around that after the creation of the identifier-less repository.

Attached is a patch with a failing test, the test passes with the validation removed, and removing the validation causes no other tests to fail."

* In some cases, accept both known senders and unknown senders, but we did not want to allow AnonymousUser to be used, so we needed to override the sender with a specific user :
<pre>
--post-user SENDER
</pre>
* In some cases, override all senders (known and unknown) with a specific user as specified above :
<pre>
--override-sender YES/NO
</pre>
* Since we are overriding the sender, and we did not want to lose this information, we opted to allow the command-line rdm-mailhandler.rb script to take custom headers and footers for the imported mail body (to be added right after the cleanup process so as to minimize interference) :
<pre>
--email-header TEXT
--email-footer TEXT
</pre>

The patch included adds :
* the above options to extra/mail_handler/rdm-mailhandler.rb
* the code to process them within app/models/mail_handler.rb

Right now we are using these options in this fashion (this is used on top of the patch from #19182), in a script called as destination for e-mail coming from the outside :
<pre>

19179,Redmine,Defect,"",New,High,Very slow performance on editing issues when projects have inherit members checked,Santi A.,"",2016-05-20 11:29,Performance,"","","","",0,2015-02-25 07:57,"",関連している #22850,"",2.5.2,"Hi,

Recently I updated all my projects checking ""Inherit members"" in order to make our life easier when you have to assign groups and roles to members.
In my scenario I have a main project and by heritage I have the rest of the projects.

Case 1:
If you try to create and edit an issue in the main project all are updated smoothly.

Case 2:
If you try to create and edit an issue in a 4 level project heritage the performance becomes in a terrible slow updating.


Note: I can't reproduce this problem when a user has admin rights.

Redmine version: 2.5.2
Mysql version: 5.5.38

I sucessfully imported the old data into a new redmine (newest version) clean install on a different server.

However now when I go to the page redmine.ardemgaz.com it no longer works (redmine is broke).

In the production.log file I am getting this error everytime I go to the page.
