When I right click the issue in the list, I get a context menu which allow easy setting of the fields.  I can tick something invoiced or not.  See the next attachment.

However, when I right click the detail of ""spent time"", the menu doesn't show all the fields and also not the custom field.  Se the fourth attachment.

This seems to be a defect, but it could be by design.  If it is by design, then I'll change this to a feature request.  However, in either case, this cannot be to difficult to fix or what?

It introduces a new apache configuration directive, @RedmineDatabaseCipherKey@, which must be set to the same @database_cipher_key@ that's used in the @config/configuration.yml@ of your redmine installation. Otherwise, @Redmine.pm@ won't be able to correctly decrypt ciphered LDAP passwords.

The modifications don't change the currently exposed behavior; without @RedmineDatabaseCipherKey@ being set and/or with an unencrypted database no decryption will be performed, leaving the passwords as stored in the database.

Two additional perl modules must be installed to decrypt ciphered passwords: @Crypt::CBC@ and @MIME::Base64@. If these modules are not available for @Redmine.pm@, no decryption will be performed."

So I have installed both Redmine-2.4.5 and Redmine-2.5.1 several times, with several combinations of Ruby/JRuby and Redmine version. I have been able to get nearly all combinations to successfully work in the webrick test server, however none of them work in tomcat 7.

I followed all steps and have created successfully .war files for the redmine projects, however when added to the auto_deploy directory of tomcat, I always get a 500 error ""Rack::ShowStatus""

News added sends out notifications to all members of the project as expected.

Scenario:
When I add a new user to a group or to the project itself and they have an invalid email, email notifications fails to send to everyone, not just the user with the invalid email.
I believe it only acts this way when the email address that is ""invalid"" has a valid domain. I.E. when I have accounts with completely fake emails (e.g. asdgasd@asd.com) then the rest of the emails still sends out to the other members, however when I have an account that has a valid domain (e.g. fake@somerealdomain.com) then the emails fail to send as a whole.

Hello, I'm a newbie.
I installed redmine on CentOS 6.5 (i386) according to [[Redmine 2.0.3 with Subversion and LDAP Authentication]] (for Redmine and Subversion through Redmine) on Centos 6, i386 - detailed.Details was listed above.
I found a problem in using, this problem could reproduce by these steps:
1.The host's IP is 192.168.1.4
2.login it as root
3.cd /var/www/repos
4.svnadmin create test
5.chown -R apache:apache test
6.login redmine server http://192.168.1.4 as administrator(Mine is admin)
7.Create a new project 'test'
8.In project 'test', through 'settings'-'Repositories'-'New repository' ，create repository.
  scm: subversion
  main reository: checked
  url:http://127.0.0.1/repos/test
  login: redmine
  password: xxxxxxxx
9.Through 'settings'-'Repositories'-'Members',add user 'redmine'
10.Click Repository menu before Settings menu, it works perfectly
11.But login the host again, do this:
12.login it as root
13.cd /var/www/repos
14.svnadmin create test1
15.chown -R apache:apache test1
16.login Redmine server http://192.168.1.4 as administrator(Mine is admin)
17.In project 'test', through 'settings'-'Repositories'-'New repository' ，create repository.
  scm: subversion
  main reository: checked
  url:http://127.0.0.1/repos/test1
  login: redmine
  password: xxxxxxxx
18.Click Repository menu before Settings menu, it reports:
  404
  The entry or revision was not found in the repository.
19.Create a new project test1, repeat steps 8-10, there are no problems.
20.I tried test2 test3..., just like above.A new repos need a new project, or it cannot be accessed.
21.I think it's a problem, so report it.

I noticed that the original consumption history that this is based off of did not include all RateClasses for the Current Rate Class lookup. As for addresses. If I include addresses or customer names you will get multiple lines
per customer where either their address or name has changed.

I received the notification above on Saturday, June 21, the ticket was actually updated on around May 6.  There is also a double response on the same ticket, it updated on the actual day the user updated the ticket and then it updated it again with the same response on this past weekend, which is more than a month later. The only difference I can see is the addition of 

""DIV.EVShortcutBanner {PADDING:10px;FONT-WEIGHT:bold;FONT-SIZE:10pt;FONT-FAMILY:verdana;BACKGROUND-COLOR:lightblue}DIV.EVAttachBanner {PADDING:3px;FONT-WEIGHT:bold;FONT-SIZE:10pt;FONT-FAMILY:verdana;BACKGROUND-COLOR:lightblue}DIV.EVShortcutMsgBody {PADDING:10px;FONT-SIZE:10pt;FONT-FAMILY:verdana}TD.EVShortcutAttName {FONT-SIZE:10pt;FONT-FAMILY:verdana}TD.EVShortcutAttSize {FONT-SIZE:7pt;FONT-FAMILY:verdana}""

Anyone else have something like this happen?  It's not every ticket, I'd its only happened a half dozen times so far but it can be confusing for ""watchers"" in other departments to get updates on closed tickets weeks after the fact...
