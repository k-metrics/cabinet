If you check a checkbox for a name and then change the search/filter and try to check another name, the previous checks do not count and those previously checked names are not added as watchers. Only the last batch of names that you check off (after your last search/filter-ing) will be added.

This seems like a defect. 
I feel like a function like this should be able to remember previously checked checkboxes as you check names and search for more names, or it should just add the user as soon as you check the checkbox and be ""real-time"", that way there is no need for the system to ""remember"" anything.

Note: This phenomena does not happen with a boolean field which is *not* defined as ""required"". In this case, 3 collapse/expand indicator lines are displayed (with misleading labels ( see #18894 ) when this ticket is created).

* Ref. 
** Issue #17003-6 
** Wiki """"Boolean: checkbox (enabled/disabled) or radio buttons *(null/yes/no)* "" in [[RedmineCustomFields]]

I think it is OK. 

But I found that both ""No"" and "" (blank, or to say, not specified) "" are grouped under same name (label) of ""none"" collapse/expand indicator lines when I specified ""Group results by"" the boolean field which is not defined as ""required"".

The tickets are grouped in 2 groups and it is right I think.

But both groups have ""none"" indicated in collapse/expand indicator line. It is not a good idea, I think.
Boolean field which is not set as ""required"" contains 3 values, ""Yes"", ""No"" and "" (blank, or to say, not specified) "", so it is better to be grouped in different labels.

Could it be changed the label of ""none"" for "" (blank, or to say, not specified) "" to ""null"", ""No Value"", or"" (blank) "" ?

Unfortunately, the Redmine::Activity. Fetcher (lib/redmine/activity/fetcher.rb) method, line 41, requires that permission be called the event type name with ""view_"" added to the front.

So, if I added the event type :dmsf_file_revision_accesses then there needs to be a permission called :view_dmsf_file_revision_accesses.

If this permission does not exist, the filter on the right hand side of the activity stream will be missing even though the permission works for the stream itself.

This does not seem to be documented anywhere and is not expected behaviour as the permission is declared as part of the acts_as_activity_provider call.

18830,Redmine,Defect,"",New,Normal,"Workflow always ""current state"" not working",Gareth Evans,"",2015-01-14 04:21,Issues workflow,"","","","",0,2015-01-13 21:31,"","","",2.6.1,"Hi guys

I've been having an issue where when I go to edit the workflow, the ""always"" grid at the top does not show the current state, that is, all of the checkboxes are unticked.
If I tick some of them, and then save, the workflow for the selected tracker and role are updated to *only* the ones i've ticked, that is, the ones that were ticked no longer apply and the status/workflow transitions that were there are gone.

Of note, I'm using SQL server.

I am not really familiar with ruby/activerecord but I am a .net/windows developer, hence the use of sqlserver (our production SQL is replicated for redundancy so I'd prefer to use this as my dbms)
Reviewing the data in the workflow database table, the records are as I'd expect them to be - with some records having 0 for author and 0 for assignee, and others with the appropriate truthy values in those columns.
Using a SQL subselect insert, I deleted all of the records where author=0 and assignee=0 then re-inserted them, copying them from where author=1 and observed that this made no difference, that is, the data was not the problem.

The schema of the database table shows the author and assignee columns defined as smallint for me, which is not a boolean type in SQL server (this would typically be ""bit not null default 0"")

The activerecord tests for sqlserver (https://github.com/rails-sqlserver/activerecord-sqlserver-adapter/blob/master/test/cases/specific_schema_test_sqlserver.rb) have an explicit test to ensure that smallint is not treated as a boolean ala mysql, but there is no test for tinyint or bit.

I dumped the contents of the workflows array; defined as follows:
<pre>
@workflows = {}
@workflows['always'] = workflows.select {|w| !w.author && !w.assignee}
@workflows['author'] = workflows.select {|w| w.author}
@workflows['assignee'] = workflows.select {|w| w.assignee}
</pre>

with the command @<%=@workflows.to_json%>@ and observed that the always array was empty, and the author and assignee arrays contained the records where author and assignee contained falsy values.
If I change the workflows code to 
<pre>
@workflows['always'] = workflows.select {|w| w.author==0 && w.assignee==0}
@workflows['author'] = workflows.select {|w| w.author==1}
@workflows['assignee'] = workflows.select {|w| w.assignee==1}
</pre>

Then all works as expected - the always grid has the appropriate tickboxes that I would expect by default

This seems to be a boolean/casting issue with sqlserver to me, and may affect other places in the codebase, so I doubt my fix for this one screen is the correct one.

18823,Redmine,Defect,"",New,Normal,Can't unassign user from issue when field is required,Tomasz Kowalczyk,"",2015-01-13 12:30,Issues,"","","","",0,2015-01-13 11:53,"","","",2.6.1,"I have set up a workflow, part of which is the status transition:

* Confirmed (field ""assignee"" read-only and empty) -> Assigned (field ""assignee"" required),
* Assigned -> Confirmed (same field constraints).

My idea was to restrict Assignee change only in transition *to* status Assigned. Sometimes developers take issues that are not meant to be taken. We have ""Not assigned"" project version, ""Platform"" category and tracker ""Info"", if either of them is set an issue is considered just for information (subtasks status, etc.), not to be acted upon.

The problem is that I can't unassign them and go back to status Confirmed because when I do that only status changes, Assignee remains set (field disappears after selecting Confirmed status from @<select>@). In Confirmed status I can't unassign user because field won't show up or Redmine will complain of field being read only.

I think that not unassigning user looks like a bug, but maybe I'm unaware of achieving desired result."

They must have short green rectangle, but the results is long green rectangle.

In lib/redmine/helpers/gantt.rb, the green rectangle is painted here:
<pre>
if coords[:bar_progress_end]
  params[:pdf].SetY(params[:top] + 1.5)
  params[:pdf].SetX(params[:subject_width] + coords[:bar_start])
  params[:pdf].SetFillColor(90, 200, 90)
  params[:pdf].RDMCell(coords[:bar_progress_end] - coords[:bar_start], height, """", 0, 0, """", 1)
end
</pre>

If a task have small progress, @coords[:bar_progress_end]@ and @coords[:bar_start]@ may have the same value because they are rounded by this code.
<pre>
# Transforms dates into pixels witdh
coords.keys.each do |key|
  coords[key] = (coords[key] * zoom).floor
end
</pre>

If @coords[:bar_progress_end] - coords[:bar_start]@ was zero, RDMCell() paints long rectangle stretched to the most right side.

and therefore validating the new (calculated) value.
The CustomField had the format Redmine::FieldFormat::IntFormat.
The new value was a true Integer: 1
But the value was refused with the message that it's not a Number!

The Reason is, that Redmine::FieldFormat::IntFormat validates the value with RegExp:

 value =~ /^[+-]?\d+$/

which will not return true if value is not a String.
I understand, that ""normally"" values of custom fields will be set via forms
and so usually all values will be Strings.

But I think IntFormat's validation should accept real Integers also!"
