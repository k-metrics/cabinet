The problem is due to the fact that @String#[]@ changed between ruby 1.8 and 1.9. In 1.8 @x[0]@ would return a fixnum representing the character, while it returned the character itself in 1.9 (""1.8 doc"":http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.8.7/String.html#method-i-5B-5D, ""1.9 doc"":http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/String.html#method-i-5B-5D). It's easily explained by the unicode support improvements in 1.9 and the fact that a single 1.9 character can map to multiple codepoints.

The easiest workaround is to let the code as is for 1.8 but only take the first codepoint above (unicode strings can have multiple codepoints per character...)."

Short form is OK.

Although February seems too long as well, it should be left as it is; in Croatian *lj* is considered one letter written with two characters.

There are a few implicit assumptions in Redmine code that this is the case, which doesn't add much benefit I think. This reference is needed in the plugin discovery mechanism, but I can see obvious reasons why it may appear anywhere else.

It has at least one disadvantage: it prevents from easily distributing plugins as gems or via an other mechanism (which I think has a long list of advantages that I could enumerate an other day).

An other motivation is that removing this would lead to clearer code I think, we could remove some @Dir.glob@ and @File.xxx@ calls in favor of new, clear methods in @Redmine::Plugin@.

I'll try to work on that and link commit to this issue."

We've been using Redmine for half a year and a little time ago have decided to change some workflow stuff.
At the 'Field Permissions' tab we have made some fields required for certain roles. But we've noticed that the changes didn't apply to all users of this role.

After investigating we've found out that this issue applies only for administrators accounts. Is that correct that administrators can leave required fields blank?

We don't have an administrator in our team, so project manager has administrator access to Redmine. And also this PM creates tasks so it's crucial for us that workflow should also apply to PM's account discarding it's administrator's status.

When changing tab, the URL is not updated, hence it breaks navigation in some minor ways, which I find annoying on a daily basis.. :
* if the user reloads the page he's sent back to the default tab, not the one he was viewing
* previous/next buttons behave counterintuitively : only the default tab remains in the history, and once you leave a tab, you never go back to it without having to re-click on the tab

The simplest solution to that is to use the History API introduced a couple years ago in most browsers, so that URL is updated whenever a click on a new tab occurs. Basically it boils down to this: <pre><code class=""javascript"">
/* better handling of history in redmine tabs */
$(function() {
  $("".tabs a"").on(""click"", function() {
    //only trigger history API if supported
    if (""replaceState"" in window.history) {
      //replace current URL with the ""href"" attribute of the current link
      window.history.replaceState(null, document.title, this.href);
    }
  })
})

Any opinion on that is welcome. If none I'll add it in the next few days, I think I'll integrate it directly in the @showTab()@ function."

With new release, I have a problem with emails thread view: if I have old mail threaded (for example per bug [A]) and now someone update the bug [A], the new mail is orphaned and not threaded with others (old mails).

This happens per a changed creation of message-id in email source.
For the previous redmine release, when the bts send a mail for example from
Date: Tue, 23 Apr 2013 11:23:09 +0200, 
I see that message-id is created as

Is this intentional or is a new behavior of timestamp.strftime routine?
