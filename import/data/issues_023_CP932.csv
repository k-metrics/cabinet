I ran across an issue with the REST API that responded with a 200 OK when I think it should respond with an error.

If I try to PUT this to an existing issue:

<pre><code class=""json"">
{ ""issue"": {
 ""assigned_to_id"": ""19""
 }
}
</code></pre>

it will respond 200 OK even if it can't change the assigned_to_id to 19, for instance if user ID 19 does not have an assignable role on the project.  Because the API reported a 200 OK, this led to a lot of confused debugging.  A 422 return with appropriate error message in the body might be more useful.

we are currently migrating our company to redmine.
Since we don't want to manage users in redmine we added LDAP Auth (and SingleSignOn).
Additionally we installed the LDAP Synchronize plugin to add all users and groups to redmine.

Most of our users won't use redmine directly. They are using one of our programs connecting to the API.

We are currently writing a program to migrate all of our old tickets from another software to redmine.

This software fetches the tickets from the old system and creates them in redmine.
To create the ticket we impersonate to the user (it's a java program so we are using this lib: https://github.com/taskadapter/redmine-java-api and call setOnBehalfOfUser on the Manager), so the author will be correct.

Most of the users haven't login to redmine yet and most never will.
When the migration software hits one of this users and calls createIssue it gets an Error 500.
The production log shows this:

When I now open the profile of the user it works. So when logging in or opening the users profile it seems to be initialized.

The problem is:
Neither now in our test environment nor in production can I open all profiles (multiple hundreds). Even if I write a script to automate it, it would just be for the initial users.
When a new user is created in the ActiveDirectory and is synced to redmine the same will happen (if I wrote earlier: most users won't use redmine directly and the program they are using does the same as the migration tool).

Is there any way to solve this?

Our current planned workaround for the migration tool would be to create the issue with our admin user and update the creator directly in the database (we have to update the created_on field anyway since we cant set it over the api).

But this would be no solution for the production environment after the migration. I don't want to open a connection to the database from the client software.

Thanks for your Help!"

Prerequisite: this happens only with MS SQL
# Filter a list of issues by grouping on the fixed version field, and showing the priority field
# Click on the Fixed version field to sort on it in descending order, click on the priority field to also sort on that field
This should result in a query like ""this one"":https://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/issues?c[]=tracker&c[]=status&c[]=author&c[]=subject&c[]=fixed_version&c[]=due_date&c[]=priority&f[]=status_id&f[]=assigned_to_id&f[]=fixed_version_id&f[]=&group_by=fixed_version&op[assigned_to_id]=%3D&op[fixed_version_id]=%3D&op[status_id]=o&set_filter=1&sort=priority%3Adesc%2Cfixed_version%3Adesc%2Cid%3Adesc&utf8=%E2%9C%93&v[assigned_to_id][]=1&v[fixed_version_id][]=121&v[fixed_version_id][]=122&v[fixed_version_id][]=119 for example
# Click on one bug of the list
Result: Error 500, Invalid query. In the log, it is indicated that there are duplicated column names in an ORDER BY clause
Note: the issue also happens on MySQL, but MySQL does not consider duplicated sort columns as an error.

The issue happens in the feature to be able to navigate with arrows to the next or previous bug in the list we came from.
As the Fixed_version field implements a call back with its own sortable columns, this comes into the group_by_sort_order statement, which then brings columns duplicated with the ones coming from the options.

Note that with a MySQL-backed Redmine site, the effect is that the order of the list can be incorrect in the previous/Next arrows on the displayed bug.

See attached patch for a suggested fix."

* without the scrum plugin all was fine

After some reseaches I realized that the upgrade of the database was not processed.
Why? 
* I tried once more:

<pre>
sudo bundle exec rake redmine:plugins:migrate RAILS_ENV=production
</pre>

* same result, error on calendar
* and the db table @sprints@ has column @start_date@, instead of @sprint_start_date@

Then I try:

*sudo bundle exec rake --trace redmine:plugins:migrate NAME=scrum RAILS_ENV=production*

Result:
* no error on calendar
* the colunm @sprints.sprint_start_date@ is there

So it is a doku-error. 
* *NAME=plugin-name* is missing
* I would suggest to prefix the cmd with *sudo*, too
