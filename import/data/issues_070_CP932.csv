The problem here is that pluck circumvents preloading, so no matter wether we do @@projects = Project.includes(:enabled_modules).where(conditions)@ in a controller, it will still trigger one extra query per project.

I'm trying to install redmine_charts2 plugin, to be able to display burndown charts.

This is my first time installing a Redmine plugin, and I'm unable to get plugin to install successfully.

Any guidance or help would be much appreciated!

My environment is:

Linux version 2.6.32-5-amd64 (Debian 2.6.32.41)

Environment:
  Redmine version                          2.3.0.stable
  Ruby version                             2.0.0 (x86_64-linux)
  Rails version                            3.2.13
  Environment                              production
  Database adapter                         Mysql2
Redmine plugins:
  no plugin installed

The steps I followed:

1. install redmine_charts2 in /opt/redmine/plugins/redmine_charts
2. install open_flash_chart in /opt/redmine/plugins/open_flash_chart
3. cd /opt/redmine; cp -r plugins/open_flash_chart/assets public/plugin_assets/open_flash_chart
4. cd /opt/redmine; rake redmine:plugins RAIL_ENV=production

The error I get is: ""rake aborted! database configuration does not specify adapter""

What am I missing?

Thank you,
Andy

We believe it may have happened after deleting a revision on the wiki history page.
We tried to repeat it on the redmine demo site with no luck, although the demo site says it was running 2.3.1.devel.11915, we are using 2.3.3.stable.

I referred from this page's SQL coding (http://www.webismymind.be/upload/documents/migrate_from_mantis_1_2.sql), altered and update my Mantis database time format.

Also, I edited the migrate_from_mantis.rake script, connection seems fine on a fresh installed Redmine until I encounter this error:

""*comparison of Fixnum with ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone failed*""


Please advice me what is the error and what I have to edit on my migrate_from_mantis.rake script. See attachment for more information. Thank you."
