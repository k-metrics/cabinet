The subtask list only includes a few fields (subject, assignee, status, %done). To improve this overview so everyone can see where the start/due date, estimated time etc. come from, it would make sense to display these fields for each subtask.

To reproduce:
* Open an issue from firefox.
* Open the same issue in another tab / browser / computer.
* From the second tab, update task properties that are selected from dropdown lists, such as ""Status"", ""Priority"", ""Assignee"" or ""% Done"".
* Hit F5 from the first tab. You will see that the task properties were updated successfully.
* Then, still in the second tab, click the ""Update"" link. You will see that still the old values are selected. Add some message and send the form, and the properties are now reverted.

It seems that Firefox, even after a page refresh, tries to remember the options selected by the user. To avoid this, a ctrl-F5 is needed. See also http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1479233/why-doesnt-firefox-show-the-correct-default-select-option"

In ApplicationController#authorize redmine checks authorization on <notextile>@project or @projects</notextile>. This triggers the code in Project#allowed_permissions which calls @enabled_modules.pluck(:name)@.

The problem here is that pluck circumvents preloading, so no matter wether we do @@projects = Project.includes(:enabled_modules).where(conditions)@ in a controller, it will still trigger one extra query per project.

Given that the EnableModule model is tiny, this could be prevented by using @enabled_modules.map(&:name)@ instead."

1. install redmine_charts2 in /opt/redmine/plugins/redmine_charts
2. install open_flash_chart in /opt/redmine/plugins/open_flash_chart
3. cd /opt/redmine; cp -r plugins/open_flash_chart/assets public/plugin_assets/open_flash_chart
4. cd /opt/redmine; rake redmine:plugins RAIL_ENV=production

The error I get is: ""rake aborted! database configuration does not specify adapter""

What am I missing?

Thank you,

Also, I edited the migrate_from_mantis.rake script, connection seems fine on a fresh installed Redmine until I encounter this error:

Please advice me what is the error and what I have to edit on my migrate_from_mantis.rake script. See attachment for more information. Thank you."
