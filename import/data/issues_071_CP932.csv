I referred from this page's SQL coding (http://www.webismymind.be/upload/documents/migrate_from_mantis_1_2.sql), altered and update my Mantis database time format.

Also, I edited the migrate_from_mantis.rake script, connection seems fine on a fresh installed Redmine until I encounter this error:

""*comparison of Fixnum with ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone failed*""


Please advice me what is the error and what I have to edit on my migrate_from_mantis.rake script. See attachment for more information. Thank you."

Now, I've set the mysql root account access with no password. I can confirm that it is accessible via terminal by 'mysql -u root' and phpmyadmin with just username 'root'.

Mantis is install in the same database with different schema name 'bugtracker' (Redmine is redmine), and I can access Mantis (version 1.2.15) with the settings below taken from config_inc.php below:


	$g_hostname = 'localhost';
	$g_db_type = 'mysql';
	$g_database_name = 'bugtracker';
	$g_db_username = 'root';
	$g_db_password = '';

What is that about? No password is password too short? How am I going to connect to Mantis database? I even tried setting different users with all grants and long passwords, I'm highly in doubt there's a problem with the script. See attachments for more info. Thank you.




P/S: What is this 'admin' and password 'mantis' setting about?

I'm running Redmine v2.3.2 under Windows Apache with  ModSSPI (for NTLM) and thin.  
The AJAX Document upload works perfect in IE and Chrome but intermittently fails in Firefox.  

The first upload can succeed, then adding more documents results in 'error' appearing in the Optional Description element and the document fails to upload.  

Looking at the Apache access logs it appears that the problem is related to authentication; with the working attempts logging user IDs and the failed attempts without.  With Chrome you can see 2 attempts and the third attempt authenticating, in IE, you see nothing.

I've tried setting SSPIPerRequestAuth but that's made no difference.  Help greatly appreciated.

This is not that hard to fix but that would make the gantt a bit more slow. So the question is: do we keep project completion display on the gantt?"

In our Redmine installation, non-members have this set of rights : 
* See and create tickets. Add notes (modify their own) and save requests (see 01.PNG)
* Must fill description and category fields for ""New"" tickets (status) (see 02.PNG)

If someone creates a ticket and the ticket remains to ""New"", then when a non-member tries to add a note to this ticket, there is an error message saying the field _category_ has to be filled up (see 03.PNG) .. It looks like the previous form does not take into account the previously set category for the ticket and it is still looking for it. The non-member issue update form only shows a description field (+ attach file button). 

I will need some help on this because it looks like there is no way for non-members to update an issue.

Cheers

Commits are correctly tied to #41, but no time gets recorded

1. 'Aleksandr Guidrevitch' has the same email in commits and redmine settings. His email contains a dot, eg some.user@somehost.com, just in case
2. Admin -> Settings -> Repositories -> 'Enable time logging' is on
3. Admin -> Settings -> Repositories -> 'Activity for logged time' is 'Development' and 'Development' is enabled activity in the project commits are done for
4. Git repository is refreshed using github_hook plugin, but it is not failure of this plugin as far as I can tell from the code.

Part of this might be the way that it deals with multiple repositories per project.

*Environment:*
Project Identifier: admin
Repo Identifier: admin (default)
Commit Hash: 7af8918f5728112193001c09b47a7874889bd987

Current this is what happens:

Spent Time Comment:

This is incorrect and not a proper Redmine formatted link. It should be either:

*With Cross-Project Identifier*

Default Repo:
<pre>
Applied in changeset

</pre>

*Or Without Cross-Project Identifier*

Thank you for your time. Please let me know if you need me to provide more information about my environment. I have seen this activity across all of my projects / repos.
