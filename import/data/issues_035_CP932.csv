I have then tried to arrange the workflow according to how the team I'm in wants to work. However, a lot of issues started appearing with what was actually selectable depending on what status the issue was in.

If you look at the screenshots provided, *I do not understand how the current Resolved status can contain the Feedback status*. I _may_ be persuaded into accepting that at least Closed would be visible no matter what status has been set, but the Feedback status, according to the workflow I've now tested with, is wrong. I have tried a lot of different arrangements to see if I could bring order to this, but unfortunately failed every time.

What I have resorted to, temporarily, is to enable any current status to select any other status. I'd rather see I could use the Workflow functionality as it was intended to use.

21210,Redmine,Defect,"",New,Normal,"Issues and Spent Time of closed subprojects are included on the overview page, but are not included on the issues, gantt or spent time details/report pages",Scott Cunningham,"",2015-11-10 22:14,Projects,"","","","",0,2015-11-10 22:14,"",関連している #12066,"",3.1.1,"If a project has closed subprojects, the overview page will show the total issues and spent time of all subprojects including the closed ones.  However, if I try to view issues, gantt or spent time, I will not see any of the tasks from the closed subprojects.  (See screenshots)

In our company, we use Redmine for many small projects that are closed when completed.  They become a subproject of a project named ""Closed"" for sorting reasons.  At the end of the year, I must summarize my departments hours for reporting reasons.  Right now, I cannot get any spent time reports unless I go into each subproject and generate a report, or reopen each subproject to generate a total report.

I am sure some users do not want to see closed subproject tasks.  I am also sure others, like me, would like to see tasks from multiple closed subproject.  Right now, Redmine's not working correctly, either way.  Maybe introducing a checkbox on the right sidebar to include tasks from closed subprojects would be the best solution.

In the meantime, if anyone can create a simple patch, or give me a hint where in the source code to dabble with, much appreciated!

Problem was initially reported by https://bitbucket.org/ViruZzz/ who is developing plugins for Redmine. One of customers complained about plugin raising exception above under certain circumstances. After investigation I think I found the problem.

Plugin contains model named @Contact@ having following association:
<pre>
has_and_belongs_to_many :projects, lambda { uniq }
</pre>

Sometimes it uses @visible@ scope to filter out projects visible to current user, giving effectively chain of @uniq@ and @visible@. That causes exception.

After taking a dive in depth of ActiveRecord I discovered that Principal model sets order for projects table (https://github.com/redmine/redmine/blob/master/app/models/principal.rb#L32) which gets merged to entire relation conflicting with uniq which adds @SELECT DISTINCT(id)@ to query.

That entire case is quite rare, it happens only if AnonymousGroup is added as member to some public project.

However, I made a patch, removing that order by name from principal association. I have totally no idea who and why added it there, maybe it is something vital, maybe not. However there is issue and I am attaching one of the solutions which works for me.

All tests are passing."
21181,Redmine,Defect,"",New,Normal,Markdown Formatter incorrectly parses lists,Sebastian Reuter,"",2015-11-08 21:44,Text formatting,"","","","",0,2015-11-08 21:44,"","","",3.1.1,"Originally I wanted to raise a bug about the markdown formatter wrongly interpreting a list sub item as code, because it ignored the double identation instead of single identation for code in lists.

But while building a proper example to reproduce the behavior easily I found that the whole list parsing (for both ordered and unordered lists) is borked.

While I would like to be able to provide exact directions to what exactly is wrong here, the more I played around with this, the more confused I got.

What I can tell for almost certain is that blank lines are at the core of this issue. Normally items should be wrapped in <p> tags when seperated by blank lines, but here (at least for unordered list items in ordered list items) instead the current ordered list is interpreted as ended and a new ordered list started.

_I used the official syntax from https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#list as reference, which describes behavior conflicting with what Redmine produces currently._

*Example Markup*

<pre>
1.  this is a list item with two child items.
    -  first child

    -  second child wrongly interpreted as code
1.   another item in the same list.
-  text wrongly interpreted as ordered list item

1. last item of the ordered list

running more than one Redmine instance on one server.

Fix it by setting the cookie path to config.relative_url_root when set,
""/"" otherwise. Rails automatically sets this config from the environment
variable RAILS_RELATIVE_URL_ROOT.
