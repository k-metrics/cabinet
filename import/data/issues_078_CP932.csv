I was running Redmine version 2.2.1 on ruby 1.8.7 under ubuntu 12.04.

I first upgraded Redmine to version 2.3.1 and all worked fine.

But then I tried to install the redmine_ckeditor plugin and one of the required gems needed ruby 1.9.3 or more.

So I decided to upgrade ruby to version 1.9.3P0 wich is available in Ubuntu 12.04.

I installed ruby 1.9.3 packages and removed the 1.8.7 ones.

After that I installed re installed all required gems and did a bundle install in redmine root directory to make shure every thing is installed.

But since I did than, every time I login to Redmine, I get an error 500 and the following text in the production.log file:

This problem seems to be caused by the view template not handling nulls in the DB.  Specifically records in the attachments table with a null value in the description field caused this Error 500.

We did manage a temporary workaround that may point to a solution. In mysql we made description field have a default of 'email attachment' and not null.
mysql workaround:
alter table attachments change description description varchar(255) not null default 'email attachment';

This solved the problem but this should most likely be best fixed in the code, not in the database and there could of course be side effects we're unaware of (thought it seems unlikely).

Suppose the main defect has priority ""Blocker"" (the highest one). Now when I create a subitem for it with priority ""Normal"", the priority of the main defect is changed to ""Normal"" too.

I think this is not ideal for two reaons: First the chosen priority might not be the one you want, yet the main priority gets overwritten without any user notice (it does not even appear in the history) and therefore invalidation report data by mistake. The user should at least be queried/notified, or only ""Blocker"" should be chosable to the subitem.

Second it does not seem very pratical to me. This mechanism assumes that the sum of the subitems equals the whole main item which might not always be the case. You can have a main item with a high priority that has a sub item with a lower one as the sub item is only one possible part of the solution of the main one. And if that assumption that subitems constitute the main item is seen as correct by the developers, than it's questionable as to why changes to the status of the subitems don't automatically set the status of the main item. To me it seems that this is inconsistent behaviour."

??<QUOTE>??
We recently had the same problem - graph rendering broke completely for a repository due to JS errors because some commits were missing the @space@ property.

Turns out that on a fresh install, where the repository in question was re-imported, the problem didn't occur, because the problematic commits didnt show up at all. Further investigation showed that those commits were basically abandoned and not connected to any branch.

I think not rendering these commits in the graph at all is much better than putting them randomly on the first branch as the patch above does.

When running the redmine:email:receive_imap with the folder, move_on_success and move_on_failure parameter I randomly get the error below, although it seems like it never occurs when there is only a single or few unread mails.  It happens with a wide variety of Redmine versions although I'm running 2.3.1 with all the latest stable gem versions.

</pre>

The problem comes down to this line of code in lib/redmine/imap.rb:
<pre>imap.fetch(message_id,'RFC822')[0].attr['RFC822']</pre>

After debugging I can confirm that the error occurs when calling [0] which means that imap.fetch returns nil.  If I add a simple nil check and do not process the mail further if it is nil, then the mail is still left unread in the gmail mailbox, but the label (folder the imap task reads from) has been removed which stil means a mail will be missed even if the task runs again.

When looking at online examples, I see most use the uid methods instead of the standard one.  I was able to solve this problem by changing lib/redmine/imap.rb to use the uid methods as listed below:

<pre>
        imap.uid_search(['NOT', 'SEEN']).each do |uid|
          msg = imap.uid_fetch(uid,'RFC822')[0].attr['RFC822']
          logger.debug ""Receiving message #{uid}"" if logger && logger.debug?
          if MailHandler.receive(msg, options)
            logger.debug ""Message #{uid} successfully received"" if logger && logger.debug?
            if imap_options[:move_on_success]
              imap.uid_copy(uid, imap_options[:move_on_success])
            end
            imap.uid_store(uid, ""+FLAGS"", [:Seen, :Deleted])
          else
            logger.debug ""Message #{uid} can not be processed"" if logger && logger.debug?
            imap.uid_store(uid, ""+FLAGS"", [:Seen])
            if imap_options[:move_on_failure]
              imap.uid_copy(uid, imap_options[:move_on_failure])
              imap.uid_store(uid, ""+FLAGS"", [:Deleted])
            end
          end
        end
</pre>

Even when the nil pointer is not thrown with the original Redmine code, the move_on_succes and move_on_failure doesn't work correctly every time.  In the mailbox I see some messages are left with only the success label and some with the original and succes label.  Moving to uid's solved this problem as well."

if i can change redmine to understand that ""2013/05/17"" is same to ""2013-05-17""."

As you can see, it shows an additional @%@ symbol (which clearly doesn't exist) and it changes the last ampersand (@&@) to @x%x@ in the URL.
I'm not sure, but this may be related to #10413.

The current base height value seems to be a bit on the low side which makes the graph pretty difficult to read. I'll add some examples further on.

I tried several values and came to the conclusion that a value of 30[1] is working best for me. What do you think?

I tried to install redmine_hipchat plugin on an Ubuntu 10.04 LTS 64 bit server. After installed, the plugin do not show up, and hence generate some error, so I just removed it.

Then I install a fresh copy of Ubuntu and download Bitnami Redmine 1.4.7 stack and check again. The plugin work on the new installed system. So I suppose the plugin is ok.

Can someone give me some tip to trouble shoot it?

If you switch the order of the trackers in the Admin screen, so it becomes ""B"" then ""A"", the user is able to create an issue as desired.

This workaround was fine until we had multiple groups of users that needed to add items to one tracker but not the others."

Applying the same filter to a native date field (like due date) the result is exactly the expected (only the overdue issues were listed, without null values).

I created a small patch, which allows you to display the description of the parent issue in the subissue form. This function could be allowed/disallowed in the system settings.

This functionality could be useful, if you have bigger workpackages and try to divide them in smaller tasks. This way, each user can track the parent issue description.

In addition to the functionality, I added two labels in en.yml, en-gb.yml and de.yml and reorganized the corresponding blocks.

I can try to define tests for these issues, even if I'm not the best testcase developer. ;-)

For further information, please take a look at the attached .diff and my screenshots.

Best regards,

I am setting up a new Redmine server for a Chinese company. They have an Active Directory server which runs just fine.
I set up everything in Redmine and it's running smoothly.
I integrated svn using mod_dav, following this tutorial:
http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/Redmine_203_with_Subversion_and_LDAP_Authentication_(for_Redmine_and_Subversion_through_Redmine)_on_Centos_6_i386_-_detailed

(with some slight modification because I'm using an x86_64 CentOS 5.9)
I set up 3 LDAP entry, which pretty much look like the following:
(1) OU=ASCII,DC=company,DC=cn
(2) OU=íÜçëìI,DC=company,DC=cn
(3) OU=People,DC=test,DC=net

The log informations are working, I tested it alot.
I have only one project, only one group that is ""developper"" on that project, and the repository is well configured.
My users in (1) and (2) is in the group, my user in (3) is not.
The 3 of them are perfectly able to log on Redmine.

When I try to ""svn ls http://redmine/svn/reponame"" or go on the web interface with account (3), I get the expected result: Go to hell.
When I try to ""svn ls http://redmine/svn/reponame"" or go on the web interface with account (1), I can access it as expected.
Buy when I try the same with account (2), or other accounts belonging to the 2nd LDAP server, I get:
[Mon May 13 17:08:31 2013] [error] [client 192.168.3.79] access to /svn/redmine failed, reason: verification of user id 'xxxxxx' not configured

My virtual host is almost exactly the same as the one given in the above tutorial, except for a slight variation (it can probably be done cleaner, but I'm not an apache pro right 
@<Limit GET PROPFIND OPTIONS REPORT>
Allow from 127.0.0.1
Require valid-user
Satisfy any
</Limit>
@
However removing this part doesn't make things work.

I believe this to be a bug in the perl authentification / authorization module which doesn't handle the Chinese OU well.
Can any Ruby guru take a look at it, it would be very much appreciated to have a fix.
I let someone more affiliated to Redmine setting the priority (or I would go for urgent !).
Here's rake about and svn info.

This breaks @__FILE__@ inside loaded files because the filename is not provided (it's set to @(eval)@ actually). This breaks the ability to provide a @gemspec@, and it may break other features of bundler that relies on current path. The @gemspec@ directive won't work out of the box with the filename provided, but at least it will be possible to manually provide an option to the current directory of the gemspec.

Bundler now provides a @eval_gemfile@ directive in its DSL that would be safer overall, but it's only here since 1.2.0, and we don't enforce such restriction for now (only restriction on bundler version is imposed by rails, requiring @~> 1.0@)."

+Notes:+
* We tryed a lot, but did not find a workaround for that bug.
* The bug exists in V2.3.1 too.
* 'Related Issues' is a powerful feature in Redmine. So we hope, that somebody improves the priority of this defect for next release V2.3.2."
