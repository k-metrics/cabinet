It is at least for a new feature we're developing at ""Planio"":https://plan.io/redmine-hosting. But in general, every API client which uses - let's say the issues API - should be able to check beforehand, if the issue tracking module is active in a particular project or not.

This patch adds @enabled_modules@ to the @projects#show@ API. They will be shown only if the @include=enabled_modules@ URL parameter is used. The behaviour is exactly the same as for issue categories and trackers.

And while we're at it, it also makes the @include=...@ URL parameters (for issue categories, trackers and enabled modules) available in the @projects#index@ API.

17588,Redmine,Defect,"",New,Normal,Warn that the authenticity token is invalid before you get the textarea to edit issues,Pablo Yanez Trujillo,"",2014-07-31 17:14,Issues,"","","","",0,2014-07-31 17:14,"","","","","I've tried to do a google search about that but I wasn't able to find anything useful. I don't know whether this should be counted as a bug or as a feature.

My problem is that I save the tabs in my browser, so when I close my browser and open it again, the last open tabs are displayed. However, Opera *does not* make a GET request to the sites in the tabs but displays the contents as they were before closing the browser (probaly it renders them from its cache).

Anyway, the redmine site of my company has been configured so that you have to log in before you 
can edit issues. It happens to me quite often that when I start my working day, and start working on the issues I've got, I lose track of the time spending on the individual issues and after working on them, opening and closing new tabs, I come across a tab with an issue of a past session (like the day before).

Here I've forgotten to press F5 to get a new authenticity token. Then I happily click on _Update_ to update the status of the issue and start editing the issue. After a couple of minutes I click on _Submit_ and get a nasty surprise:

<pre>
422

Invalid form authenticity token.
</pre>

If you go back (by pressing the backspace-key or clicking on the back-button of the browser) then you realize that you've lost everything, since the _Update_-Link executes

<pre>
showAndScrollTo(""update"", ""issue_notes""); return false;
</pre>

and even if you execute it again, the form fields are all empty again :(


On some occasions I've lost more than 30 minutes of typing... that's very frustrating, specially when you are in a hurry and need to type everything again.

So, wouldn't it make more sense that when you click on _Update_ instead of getting the textarea right away, you get first an error message/warning that your csrf token is invalid thus preventing you from wasting you time in the first place?

Notes :
1) This is related to #12893 (obviously on purpose, see line 216 of app/models/issue.rb:
    self.attributes = issue.attributes.dup.except(""id"", ""root_id"", *""parent_id""*, ""lft"", ""rgt"", ""created_on"", ""updated_on"")

2) The current behaviour for 1st result is on purpose: the  error message is triggered by line 600 of issue.rb:
      elsif (@parent_issue != parent) && (*all_dependent_issues.include?(@parent_issue)* || @parent_issue.all_dependent_issues.include?(self))
