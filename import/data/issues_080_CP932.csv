This breaks the subsequent loading of all other functions in application.js, which halts most Javascript execution because adding warnLeavingUnsavedMessage to the window.load event is the first thing every page does.

* Semicolons
* Commas
* Comparison operators

Have not done anything about other warnings ; the one that concerned me most was the warning about a fall-through in a case statement, but without a comment to the contrary and no familiarity with the code, cannot be sure this is not intentional."

I guess that the problem is around sub-URI.

13790,Redmine,Defect,"",Closed,Urgent,CSV Export problem,Zaq1 Dev,"",2013-04-20 10:56,Time tracking,"","","","",0,2013-04-17 12:31,2013-04-20 10:56,次のチケットと重複 #13618,Duplicate,2.3.0,"I will try and be as explanatory as possible, I have tried to find a solution, but couldnt but when I investigated the issues its missing a key variable, explanation goes below!

I installed the latest redmine version 2.3.0, last week and am onto 2nd week of testing, going successfully and smoothly, except for one thing:

I navigated to http://MY_LOCAL_IP:8000/time_entries/

When I apply any filter, the atom exports fine with filtered results only, but export to csv returns all the results.

Since I am a programmer, but in PHP, I tried to investigate the issue and found following:

ATOM URL: time_entries.atom?c[]=project&c[]=spent_on&c[]=user&c[]=activity&c[]=issue&c[]=comments&c[]=hours&f[]=spent_on&f[]=user_id&f[]=&key=7bd4ae99e59fad79fab2557b444b0845d9d9b720&op[spent_on]=*&op[user_id]==&utf8=?&v[user_id][]=4

CSV URL: time_entries.csv?c[]=project&c[]=spent_on&c[]=user&c[]=activity&c[]=issue&c[]=comments&c[]=hours&f[]=spent_on&f[]=user_id&f[]=&op[spent_on]=*&op[user_id]==&utf8=?&v[user_id][]=4

Difference between the 2 is very minor, CSV URL is missing the KEY variable, when I added the key variable and tested, it gave me correct CSV file with filtered output.

Since I am not vey well versed with Ruby and Rails, It is difficult for me to actually go through the model/views and controller, however I am still trying myself if I come across a solution I will share it with you folks, but if there is someone out there who can point it out to me explicitly on where to make the change it will make my life alot easier.

Problem description.

REST API.  
<pre>
 GET /issues/[id].xml?include=changesets
</pre>

The response does not include information identifying the changeset repository, just the revision number.

Looking at app/views/issues/show.api.rsb it appears that the code only returns the revision number (I checked current redmine trunk and it does the same).

The problem was ""discovered"" when a user used the REST API to retrieve an issue that contained a revision reference from another project."

Encountered unexpected behavior yesterday when i accidentally added a Git archive cloned from another site (buildroot in this case) which contained a lot of commit-messages like 

<pre>
""Closes #1123""
</pre>

This ended up in a lot of actions like:

<pre>
Updated by Anonymous about 9 hours ago

    Status changed from New to Resolved
    % Done changed from 0 to 100

Comment Edit

Applied in changeset alleatoautomationplatform:buildroot|commit:4f0361ab2ca4f25207c84b557e31319c9a417a76.
</pre>

This was not only in the project the Repository is in but sitewide.

The user Anonymous have no permissions set.

This differs in two ways from my expected behavior:

1) The anonymous user should not be able to close issues.
2) A repo commit should only be able to modify issues in the same project as the repo.

This is an old installation that have gone through several upgrades. Unfortunately I don't have time to reproduce it in a clean environment but I thought it might be best reporting it anyway since it is security related.

by google, seems there is performance issue in git itself,(in my case, the git command take about 3 minutes). wonder if redmine can back to normal status after the git command without restart?


Tons of thanks.

This used to work in previous releases, and is an important part of our workflow.

I believe this is a regression introduced by issue #8794.  I was able to restore the old behavior by reverting commit r11641 as seen in the attached patch.

Steps to reproduce:
# Be running redmine 2.3.0
# Create 3 new issues (issues 1, 2, and 3)
# Assign the parent task of of issues 2 and 3 to issue 1
# Try to add a relation that issue 3 follows issue 2
# Observe that adding the relation fails with the error: ""This relation would create a circular dependency""
