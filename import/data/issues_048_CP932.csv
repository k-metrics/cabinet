19174,Redmine,Defect,"",Needs feedback,Normal,db migrate error from old version to 2.6,Jasen Burkett,Jean-Philippe Lang,2015-03-26 11:41,"",Candidate for next minor release,"","","",0,2015-02-24 23:12,"","","","","I did the typical mysqldump to get all the data from an existing (VERY OLD) redmine install that is being used.

I sucessfully imported the old data into a new redmine (newest version) clean install on a different server.

However now when I go to the page redmine.ardemgaz.com it no longer works (redmine is broke).

In the production.log file I am getting this error everytime I go to the page.
    Started GET ""/"" for 10.2.2.67 at 2015-02-24 21:55:23 +0000
Processing by WelcomeController#index as HTML

  app/controllers/application_controller.rb:150:in `force_logout_if_password_changed'    

When I imported the new data, I have not been able to do the following:
    rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production    

because I get an error... here is the first part of that error....

    rake aborted!
StandardError: An error has occurred, all later migrations canceled:

I seriously need some help here.

There one one confirmed and several potential XSS vulnerabilities in
Redmine's flash rendering.

h3. Description

When rendering flash messages, Redmine unconditionally marks the
rendered messages as html_safe. This leads to all html special
characters in the flash message to be rendered as HTML unless they are
manually escaped beforehand.

In several places in Redmine, the message is not sufficiently escaped
and allows the rendering of raw, user-supplied values.

Example exploit:

Given a user with the following string configured as the email address
(which is accepted by the mail validations):

    ""><script>alert('Vulnerable!')</script>""a@a.bc

When that user sends himself a test mail using the admin/test_mail
action, the configured email is pushed unescaped in the flash message,
resulting in the included javascript to be executed.

This can be used in a targeted attack as a reflected XSS to perform
actions as an administrator.

The attached patch also fixes other places where potentially unsafe
information is passed in a flash message, including an issue similar to
the one described above concerning mail registration.

This vulnerability is in Redmine since at least 2.3, possibly much
longer. It is advised to backport the patch to all supported versions of
Redmine and to release updated versions.

h3. Credits

This issue was discovered by Holger Just of Planio.

Redmine search doesn't support or use full text searching features of mysql, postgres, lucene or elasticsearch, etc. which means it unfortunately doesn't scale well.  The @like %keyword%@ query basically does a table scan which can easily take 10+ seconds on a medium database with decent hardware (Amazon EC c3.large - high CPU instance).

We tried the ""elastic search plugin"":https://github.com/Undev/redmine_elasticsearch (it's still in early beta) for Redmine but it gave unreliable results and turned out to degrade our user confidence in the search.

*Solution*

After looking at what other ticketing/issue/case management solutions do, I see many of them include a ""past week/month/year"" in their search and it usually has a default value of past year or month.

This patch adds a dropdown to select last week/month/year/all time on the search screen and defaults to last year as shown in attached screen shot.  I was able to use existing translations except for the newly added ""label_last_year"".  I followed the conventions of the rest of your code base as far as possible.

For CSV Export I've found a bug when users uses redmine general_csv_separator in subject or description.

Steps to reproduce problem (I assume that general_csv_separator used is ;)
1) open a new issue
2) as subject use test;1 and description test;1
3) save issue
4) export as csv
5) open csv with excel, you don't see inserted test or description


To solve this problem, I suggest *together* try to follow best practices with CSV (starting for example from ""Wikipedia"":https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values ).
Following Wikipedia links I've found ""this"":https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180#section-2 (see 6):

<pre>
  6.  Fields containing line breaks (CRLF), double quotes, and commas
       should be enclosed in double-quotes.  For example:

       ""aaa"",""b CRLF
       bb"",""ccc"" CRLF
       zzz,yyy,xxx
</pre>

so i propose to change redmine csv export when a field there is csv separator, adding double-quotes, what do you think?


Note: I know that I can change my csv separator settings in locale, for example using another separator as | or $, but this is not solving this issue, because users can enter anything in any field.

Note2: could please admins add a new category for issues related to CSV export?

Thank you

It shows up in the front-end as a 500 error and the external command reporting ""Bad file descriptor"".

As far as I understand it this can't be fixed without some changes to Java, but we can avoid triggering the bug by not using the r+ mode unnecessarily.

In lib/redmine/scm/adapters/abstract_adapter.rb:254 in the ""shellout"" method we have this code:

            mode = ""r+""
            IO.popen(cmd, mode) do |io|
              io.set_encoding(""ASCII-8BIT"") if io.respond_to?(:set_encoding)
              io.close_write unless options[:write_stdin]
              block.call(io) if block_given?
            end

but we can avoid the JRuby bug in many situations by changing this to:

            mode = options[:write_stdin] ? ""r+"" : ""r""
            IO.popen(cmd, mode) do |io|
              io.set_encoding(""ASCII-8BIT"") if io.respond_to?(:set_encoding)
              block.call(io) if block_given?
            end

i.e. not using ""r+"" mode when we don't need to - I think this code is equivalent.

As far as I can tell only GitAdapter.revisions needs the :write_stdin option, and we could eliminate that one usage by pushing all the revisions onto the command line instead.

I hope that makes sense."

Same things happens with .xml serialisation
<pre>
 /issues.xml?updated_on<2014-02-12T00:00:00Z
</pre> 

Is the bug mysql-related ? I am convinced by the test test_index_should_allow_timestamp_filtering that it should work.

h2. Updated-on for related tickets

Another related thing, but I think it is an usage issue from my part : updated_on for issues that are related to other issues is not updated when new related issues are connected.

Eg my use case is : I would like to list ""Macro"" issues by desc date, with my ""macro"" Issue date depending on when   a ticket was added as related to my Macro issue, and not when the macro Issue was last edited.
