16353,Redmine,Defect,"",Closed,Normal,Regexp bug in JournalsController regexp handling when quoting existing journal entries,Stephane Lapie,Jean-Philippe Lang,2014-03-29 15:41,Issues,2.5.1,"","","",0,2014-03-14 11:12,2014-03-29 15:41,"",Fixed,2.3.1,"I have stumbled upon a very nasty bug with journal entries quoting, when a user writes an entry with a ""pre"" tag but forgets to put a proper ""/pre"" tag.

When trying to quote such an entry where a ""pre"" tag is not closed properly, the regexp engine can go haywire (process stuck in gsub() forever, CPU usage 100%, if it happens with all threads of an existing instance, the whole Redmine instance becomes unusable until the process finishes/is terminated) with cases where a lot of whitespaces/tabs/newlines are present.

Upon stumbling on that bug, and killing the affected Rails processes, I got the following trace :
<pre>
Completed 500 Internal Server Error in 7016997ms
SignalException (SIGTERM):
  app/controllers/journals_controller.rb:69:in `gsub'
  app/controllers/journals_controller.rb:69:in `new'
</pre>
Which allowed me to narrow it down the code where ""pre"" blocks are replaced with ""[...]"".

Studying the ruby regular expression spec (http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_regular_expressions.htm) it seems the following expression <pre>%r{<pre>((.|\s)*?)</pre>}m</pre> has redundant elements : a ""dot"" is supposed to match anything including newlines, when the regexp has the 'm' flag active, so there is no purpose in having a ""or"" match with whitespaces.

I tried the following fix on my side (basically, removing the redundant ""or \s"" check and sticking with ""."" and the 'm' flag) :
<pre><code class=""diff"">

     # Replaces pre blocks with [...]

     @content << text.gsub(/(\r?\n|\r\n?)/, ""\n> "") + ""\n\n""
   rescue ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound
</code></pre>
and it seems to fix the issue.

How to reproduce/check (it ""works"" in every case, as in, it WILL eventually end, as it is not an infinite loop, but the execution time varies greatly) :

This works (obviously) :
<pre>
$ time ruby -e 'print ""<pre>  lalala       \tlalala</pre>"".gsub(%r{<pre>((.|\s)*?)</pre>}m, '""'[...]'""')' 
[...]
real	0m0.015s
user	0m0.011s
sys	0m0.004s
$ time ruby -e 'print ""<pre>  lalala       \tlalala\n     lalala\r\n   lala\r    \n        lalalla \t\n</pre>"".gsub(%r{<pre>((.|\s)*?)</pre>}m, '""'[...]'""')' 
[...]
real	0m0.018s
user	0m0.014s
sys	0m0.005s
</pre>

I apologize in advance for the display break, but there is no way I can provide proper sample code for this problem otherwise... (I hope this does not trigger anything weird by writing it in the description, if this has not been fixed in latest versions...)

These take more and more time as you add more characters, rendering a whole running ruby process unusable :

Some users have set the following preferences for mail notification:
* Only for things I watch or I'm involved in
* I don't want to be notified of changes that I make myself -> Deactivated (so they explicitly want to be notified about changes they make themselves)

The expected behaviour is, the author of an issue is receiving a notification the moment he is creating the issue or every time he/she is updating the issue.
Unfortunately this is not working for my Redmine. Regardless of the setting (no_self_notified), users never receive a notification for the changes they make themselves. It's also not working for watchers and assigned users, I got the impression that the setting is simply ignored.


Maybe I'm wrong and I'm expecting a different behaviour than provided by Redmine. I would appreciate any help."
