Now the filter for issues, e.g. status, categories are not applied and all opened issues in the project are exported.

I was confirmed that this problem only occurs in version 3.2, not in 3.1.

I found 2 points.

1. CSV export options form doesn't send proper parameter.
\app\views\issues\index.html.erb line 80
form_tag(params.merge({:format => 'csv',:page=>nil}) a form tag with parameters in the action attribute. 
But, parameters don't send to the controller.(This has occurred even 2.6.)
And so, IssuesController#index tries to get the filter from session data.

2. Format of session data changed in 3.2
queries_helper.rb line 215
<pre>
session[:query][:project_id] != (@project ? @project.id : nil)
</pre>
returns nil in 3.2.

session[:query][:project_id]  is nil. 
session[:query][""project_id""]  has the project_id.

And so, IssuesController#index cannot get the filter from session data.

22105,Redmine,Defect,"",Closed,Normal,Responsive layout. Change menu selector in responsive.js.,Vasil Kovalevsky,Jean-Philippe Lang,2016-04-03 14:05,UI - Responsive,3.2.2,"","","",0,2016-02-24 04:20,2016-04-03 14:05,"",Fixed,"","Hello.
In our redmine we are using custom menu with sub items and other cool things.
Everything was nice before there is was added responsive layout in redmine.
Menu works before window resize less than 899px (responsive.css media max-width: 899px) and groving up more 899px our menu stays flatten (in mobile view a lot of functions works good).
Reason - wrong (for us) selector in responsive.js

So, there is 2 variables (functions):
_initMobileMenu and _initDesktopMenu
_initMobileMenu:
<pre>
$('#main-menu > ul').detach().appendTo('.js-project-menu');
$('#top-menu > ul').detach().appendTo('.js-general-menu');
$('#sidebar > *').detach().appendTo('.js-sidebar');
$('#account ul').detach().appendTo('.js-profile-menu'); // bad selector
</pre>
better change to
<pre>
$('#main-menu > ul').detach().appendTo('.js-project-menu');
$('#top-menu > ul').detach().appendTo('.js-general-menu');
$('#sidebar > *').detach().appendTo('.js-sidebar');
$('#account > ul').detach().appendTo('.js-profile-menu'); // changed to only child uls (no subchilds)
</pre>

_initDesktopMenu:
<pre>
$('.js-project-menu > ul').detach().appendTo('#main-menu');
$('.js-general-menu ul').detach().appendTo('#top-menu'); // bad selector
$('.js-sidebar > *').detach().appendTo('#sidebar');
$('.js-profile-menu ul').detach().appendTo('#account');  // bad selector
</pre>
better change to
<pre>
$('.js-project-menu > ul').detach().appendTo('#main-menu');
$('.js-general-menu > ul').detach().appendTo('#top-menu'); // changed to only child uls (no subchilds)
$('.js-sidebar > *').detach().appendTo('#sidebar');
$('.js-profile-menu > ul').detach().appendTo('#account');  // changed to only child uls (no subchilds)
</pre>

And responsive.js was wrote that we cannot patch anything there, only direct change in source (or I missed something), but we dont change any source of redmine (its our rule).

Please, if its not hard, add this small changes to some release, its not about redmine, its about our system. Of cource, we can change our menu structure (move ul to div\span), but its very long for us (a lot of changes need to do: style, rednder, js, items tree).
Now we just disabled responsive menu, but its not good solution.
Thanks in advance."

This is not the only source of this error, because of @:controller@ parameter is used in relative form, so any usage of @ActionController::Base#url_for@ would throw an error (e.g. during _menu_ generation).

The only way for a while to bypass the error is to *avoid namespaces in plugins*.

To produce an error you need to generate a plugin with controller using namespaces, like @Reports::BadPluginController < ApplicationController@, which action renders as redmine part (using standard redmine layout), and route to it @get 'projects/:project_id/reports/bad_plugin'@.

We can see that both realParent and ancestorParent have the same parent_id, as such they are brothers...

Description:

If an admin performs a password reset on a user and generates a new password ( by checking the Generate password box ), and unchecks the option to send the email with the new credentials to the user, there is no way to obtain the new credentials for the user, making the functionality useless.

Redmine should detect that the password will not be sent to the user, and display the generated password to the administrator performing the reset.

I'm using Git with Redmines redmine_git_hosting plugin in combination with gitolite. This is working great except the following scenario:
Commit some changes to the local repo with a message like ""test test IssueID #22"" and push it to origin master using this command: ""git push origin master"". Afterwards change the commits message on the local repo with ""git rebase -i"". Try to push this to origin master, it won't work (this is a correct behavior). To force the push use ""git push origin master -f"" and the commit will be pushed. You can see the new revision hash in the repository view and all seems to be good. But if you look in that related issues view, you can see the first commit AND the rebased commit. If you rebase your commits several Times, this could cause an undefined number of commits that are not exist anymore related to several issues.

So the first commit does not exist anymore and it seems that redmine is using some cache mechanism to persist that commit information. I know I can remove the relation of the first commit to that issue, by click on the firsts commit hash and click on the anchor removal icon. But I want to remove the whole set of outdatet commits which are obsolete by rebase.

It seems that r15026 results in fonts too big in some email clients (tested in latest Zimbra Web Client 8.6.0, latest Thunderbird 38.5.1 and with Gmail). Could this issue be related to r14541 or r14540 or some other changes in *3.2.0*?

I'm running 3.0.1/Ubuntu 14.04 and tried installing the Redmine My Page Customization plugin by Rupesh J. The installation goes smoothly, but as soon as I try using one of the plugin blocks I get a 404. Once I get the 404, I need to uninstall the plugin and restart nginx to get the my page area working again.

The log shows that it's unable to find a template, but I'm new to rails and don't know how to go about fixing the issue or even understanding why it's happening.

This is happening when I try to install other 'my page' plugins as well, so I'm guessing it's something to do with my setup/configuration. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

Patch 0001 will add some extra span elements which make this possible for theme CSS. It also improves XSS resilience by using the @safe_join@ helper instead of manually declaring strings @.html_safe@, see ""here"":http://makandracards.com/makandra/954-don-t-mix-array-join-and-string-html_safe and ""here"":http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4191028/rails-3-0-2-arrayjoin-html-safe. This patch shouldn't change things for existing themes and could therefore applied to core without any doubt, IMHO.

Patch 0002 actually changes Redmine's core CSS to take advantage of this and display the breadcrumbs on a separate line. I feel it looks better this way, but I realize that this is just my opinion, so I would see this patch as optional and up for discussion.
