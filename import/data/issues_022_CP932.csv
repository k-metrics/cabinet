Copying is often done between issues which are not logically related (for instance, just to save time to fill in certain 'Defect' fields; still, defects themselves are not related). All other types of relations in Redmine are 'real', in a sense that they reflect actual dependencies affecting project execution and planning. The 'copy' relationship, on the other hand, obfuscates real dependencies between issues, and therefore is recommended to be removed."

On the actual version as in the las trunk, when trying to create a new description with more than 65536 characters, Redmine answers with an error 500.

This happens when the adapter ActiveRecord of MySQL is used, as the field description is of type :text and the maximum limit that it accepts is 65536 as i explain on the next link: https://www.packtpub.com/books/content/working-rails-%E2%80%93-activerecord-migrations-models-scaffolding-and-database-completion

With this patch this problem is solved as it adds a validation in case of the adapter being MySQL.

- being vector graphics, they are scalable an can be resized without losing quality.
- can be customized directly from CSS (size, colour, etc)
- less HTTP requests to server because they are loaded only with one or a few requests. Now, Redmine make a request for each image.
- some of the current custom themes already use icon fonts (Abacus theme, Minelab, PurpleMine2, our custom theme and I think the theme from plan.io).

We're interested to contribute with a patch that implements the FontAwesome icons, but because there are at least two ways to implement them, we want some feedback before from Redmine contributors and/or users.

1. *Using i tags*: 

Advantages:
* Is the recommended way on their ""official page"":http://fontawesome.io/examples/#basic 
* We can use all the build-in rules available in the FontAwesome CSS.

Disadvantages:
* it'll be required to add the i elements in views.

2. *Only from css*

Advantages:
* the views will not be modified

Disadvantages:
* The build-in rules must be reimplemented in the current  CSS
* The icons will be defined using their unicode. For example, the fa-pencil icon (similar with the current images for icon-edit) has the unicode f040.

Only for demo purposes, I've attached a patch that replaces the icons from issue page with font awesome icons (using i tags). "

The bug occurs when trying to export to pdf a list of issues (on the issues page) with a huge amount of columns (around 50 or more). It happens even if there is only 1 issue to export. 

To reproduce the bug, you can create around 40 custom fields with a random name (30 chars) / format and assign them to a tracker / project. then create an issue with random content in the fields. Then on the issues page, export to pdf with all columns included.


Because anyway the pdf would not look nice with such big amount of columns, we could perhaps forbid the export if there are too many columns (lets say > 40) selected in the export. 

This is what I added to mitigate the error, in app/controllers/issues_controller.rb#index:

<pre><code class=""ruby"">
if params[:format] == 'pdf' && @query.column_names.count > 40
  redirect_to(:back)
  flash[:error] = ""Please reduce the amount of columns selected.""
  return
end

After further investigation, I found the problem to be located in lib/redmine/export/pdf.rb, in the RDMMultiCell method. So it may be due to RBPDF...

            .select('tags.id, tags.name, tags.taggings_count, COUNT(taggings.id) as count')
            .group('tags.id, tags.name, tags.taggings_count')
            .where(taggings: { taggable_type: 'Issue', taggable_id: issues_scope})
</pre>
In this example used fragment of code from plugins/redmine_tags/lib/redmine_tags/patches/issue_patch.rb (available_tags)

The problem is that count is reserved keyword and to name column it should look like this 
<pre>'COUNT(taggings.id) as ""COUNT""'</pre>

In my fork i located few more used keywords: position, admin.

I'll make a patch, if i'll have time, but it would be nice if someone fix it."
