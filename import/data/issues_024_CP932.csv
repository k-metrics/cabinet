23693,Redmine,Defect,"",Closed,Normal,"Error in wiki ""Installing a plugin""",eugen hanussek,"",2016-08-26 17:30,"","","","","",0,2016-08-26 15:45,2016-08-26 17:18,"",Invalid,3.3.0,"after installing redmine 3.3.0 I add the scrum-plugin according the wiki [[Plugins#Installing-a-plugin|how to install]]. 
First all seems to be OK. Here the config:
!redmine.PNG!

Then we noticed an error on Calendars. This seems to be the same as reported by ""Meindert Oldenburger"":https://redmine.ociotec.com/boards/11/topics/54 . Meindert's ""workaround""-hint is OK.

But we got another error:

</pre>

* without the scrum plugin all was fine

After some reseaches I realized that the upgrade of the database was not processed.
Why? 
* I tried once more:

<pre>
sudo bundle exec rake redmine:plugins:migrate RAILS_ENV=production
</pre>

* same result, error on calendar
* and the db table @sprints@ has column @start_date@, instead of @sprint_start_date@

Then I try:

*sudo bundle exec rake --trace redmine:plugins:migrate NAME=scrum RAILS_ENV=production*

Result:
* no error on calendar
* the colunm @sprints.sprint_start_date@ is there

So it is a doku-error. 
* *NAME=plugin-name* is missing
* I would suggest to prefix the cmd with *sudo*, too

The problem is in @lib/redmine/helpers/gantt.rb@. When @#pdf_task@ is called, @coords[:bar_end] - coords[:bar_start]@ happens to be 0. The cause for this is the zoom factor applied in @#coordindates@ and the subsequent @#floor@. By adding some @Rails.logger@ statements I got this:

<pre>
coords[start]: 92/1, zoom: 36/73

I've been reading forums and issues here for a couple of hours now and I'm unable to solve the problem, but I think I have a good idea of what is happening now.

After doing the installation in the same server I have gitlab, I did try to make the relation of the project with the repo, without success. All the permissions are ok and the paths are correct, but the error keeps saying the directory is not a repository, which I know it is. However, I did one test. I made another installation of redmine in another server and did a mirror of the same repo in that new server... it worked without any problem. 

Then I made another test: If I create a brand new repo as bare, and try to use it in the same server, it will not work.

I request support to solve a problem I'm having with the CRM Plugin AGILE PRO version 1.4.1. I am not able to use, every time I do an action on any project using the boards activities, after clicking ""apply"" is displayed the ""Internal Error"".

Below the return Redmine CRM support. In addition, this attached information necessary to understand the problem.

*****************
We investigated this problem again. It is the problem of redmine core. There are too much data in the query if you have lot of statuses. When you've used light version of agile plugin there Were less parametres added to the query. Pro version has more parametres. But the root cause of the problem is in the redmine sourse code.

You may open the ticket on http://redmine.org/issues and describe the situation in the same way as for us. And add que the problem Could be Reproduced with the list of issues not only with agile board. If there are too much statuses issues list crashes with 500 error too.
