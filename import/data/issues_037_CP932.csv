This however can lead to inconsistencies in the automatically calculated done ratios.

For example: issue C with a done ratio of 50% and an open status, which is a subtask of issue B with a done ratio of 70% automatically set by its (open) status, which itself is a subtask of issue A, with a status that doesn't automatically set the done ratio. In that case, A will have an automatically calculated done ratio of 50% because it will be calculated based on the leaf's done ratios, i.e. from C, although its only direct child has a done ratio of 70%.

Is there any rationale to keeping the calculation of the done ratio based on the leaves? I would like to change it to be calculated based on the done ratios of the direct children. If this is an acceptable change I can work on a patch."

I've configured ""Parent task attributes > Priority"" to ""Independent of subtasks"" (see attachment:""Screenshot from 2015-10-14 11-59-18.png""), but when I want to change the priority of a parent, the field is still grayed out (see attachment:""Screenshot from 2015-10-14 11-59-28.png"").

Tasks: TOP => redmine:migrate_from_trac
</pre>

Please correct me if I am wrong, as I have absolutely no idea about ruby on rails programming, but (after reading throught this issue, which really ha nothing to do with the migration script: https://github.com/arkhitech/redmine_timesheet_plugin/issues/49) I assume that the Problem are those two lines:

<pre>
180           TracMigrate::TracAttachment.all(:conditions => [""type = 'ticket' AND id = ?"", self.id.to_s])
</pre>

<pre>
235           TracMigrate::TracAttachment.all(:conditions => [""type = 'wiki' AND id = ?"", self.id.to_s])
</pre>

which passes arguments to the all() function, which doesnt accept any arguments anymore. This seems to have changed in some Ruby on Rails Version. Maybe someone knows how to fix this and could provide a patch I could test? I tried myself, but with litteraly no knowledge about Ruby on Rails programming I failed =P

I attached the migrate_from_trac.rake with all the patches included."

Precondition:
1. There are multiple trackers defined ( Requirements, Clarifications, Issues, etc)
2. There are multiple roles defined ( Lead, Developer, Tester, etc)
3. Not all trackers are accessible by Developer role (It is set as read only for all fields in workflow admin page including ""Trackers"" field for particular tracker, say Requirements)

> a. Requirments

5. All trackers are added in a project.

Steps:
Add a user with developer role in a project which is having all the above trackers.
Try to create a new issue with developer role

Actual:
Only ""Status"" combo box will be visible.

Expected:
All fields that are to be visible for the particular role should be visible in the new issue report page. in this case the ""clarifications"" tracker shall be shown for developer role.

Workaround:
Set the Tracker visibility 'view-able' for all trackers regardless of roles defined in ""Workflow"" admin page."

We have a strange issue with Redmine. Hope you guys can help us or give a little hint where to look for the solution. The problem that we encounter is that the first reaction assigned to a user in an issue isn't send by email to the person. When you create a second reaction it will be send. 

This is what we do:

* User A sends an email to Redmine (or adds one using the GUI) that will be assigned to another user in the system
* As expected the new message is visible at the project
* User B opens the issue and adds a reaction and at the same time he assigns the issue back to user A
* User B stores the update ;)
* You would expect that user A receives a notification by email since the account setting is configured with the option ""mail notification for all issues assigned to me"". User A does not receive the reaction by email.
* Now... User B adds a new reaction. The message is still assigned to user A. No the strange thing happens, user A received a email notification!

The SMTP server is allowed to send all emails from the Redmine machine without any restrictions. Looking at the mail server log. The first message is never delivered at the server, the second is.

We've also tested the same procedure with external email accounts and SMTP servers. Same problem :(

At the moment we are running version 3.1.1. We've migrated from a 2.x version, in both situations we had the same problem. We've also tested this with other accounts in Redmine, some account have the same issue. Others work like a sunshine...

Do you have a clue where we need to look so we can solve this strange thing? Strange it is since the behaviour (as said) isn't happening with all accounts although the notification settings are the same.

Thanks for your reaction!"

This is caused by the current implementation of showTab in application.js, because it only assumes the case of having only one tab navigation on one page (see source:trunk/public/javascripts/application.js#L319).

I have created several custom fields that are of the ""List"" type. I have enabled multiple selections for them and so when I use them in an issue, they look like a scroll-able box with a list of options.
The box does not behave in a user-friendly way when using Chrome. This applies to Chrome Browser only, Firefox and IE seems to be okay...

h2. Problem Description:

The box itself shows 4 options at a time with a vertical scrollbar to the right. When there are a lot more than 4 available options, you are required to scroll through the list.
Currently, when you *click on the scrollbar arrows* (up or down) it scrolls through about *2 lines at a time*. This is okay.
On the other hand, when you use the *mousewheel* to scroll through the list, it looks like it scrolls through about *6 lines at a time*. This is NOT OKAY because it tends to completely skip through 2 of the options and I never see them until I click on the arrows to scroll.

On other browsers, the scrollwheel scrolls through 3 lines at a time (the normal default for mouse wheel) as expected, which is Okay."

I looked at config/locales folders and there is a pt-BR.yml file there, with all values.

I did a test: renamed the pt.yml (Portuguese Portugal) and restarted the Redmine application. After the rename, Redmine starts in English. 

That's means that even the language is set to pt-BR, Redmine looks for the pt.yml file."

Now, I want to integrate hgweb (Mercurial). the configuration of Apache is easy:
<pre>
        PerlLoadModule Apache::Redmine
        ScriptAlias /hg  ""/var/www/html/hg/hgweb.cgi""
        <Location /hg >
            AuthType Basic
            AuthName ""Redmine Mercurial Repository""
            AuthUserFile /dev/null
            Require valid-user
            #Redmine auth
            PerlAccessHandler Apache::Authn::Redmine::access_handler
            PerlAuthenHandler Apache::Authn::Redmine::authen_handler
            RedmineDSN ""DBI:mysql:database=redmine;host=localhost""
            RedmineDbUser ""redmine""
            RedmineDbPass ""redmine""
            #RedmineCacheCredsMax 10
        </Location>
</pre>
hgweb is working well if I comment out the redmine auth parts. If I try to authenticate with redmine I always get an _401 Unauthorized_ message.

I can login into my redmine installation with the used username and password, but it's not working over the pearl module.
